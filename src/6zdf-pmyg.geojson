De igual forma, las estrategias y acciones para su manejo deben responder de manera real y efectiva a las dinámicas que las originan, reconociendo en ellas sus particularidades y dimensiones.b.  Elementos incluidos en la medidaLas municipalidades pueden promover edificaciones sostenibles, aplicando los siguientes criterios:\uf0d8\tTomar en cuenta las 9 zonas bioclimáticas definidas por el Ministerio de Vivienda y según el  tipo  de  edificación  (vivienda  nueva,  vivienda  existente,  hoteles,  salud,  educación, oficinas, comercial), anticipando variaciones futuras que pueden ser extremas en el diseño.\uf0d8\tPrever desde la planificación los efectos del sol, viento y lluvia en las construcciones según su  orientación  y  configuración  para  lograr  confort  térmico,  lumínico,  ventilación  y  la habitabilidad de las viviendas.\uf0d8\tPromover el uso de fuentes renovables que aprovechen el sol, el viento, la lluvia y la neblina. Estudiar los efectos “barrera” o “embudo” en las construcciones, así como al interior de las manzanas, para poder generar recomendaciones y tener en cuenta posibles problemas que ocasionarían los vientos fuertes.\uf0d8\tAdaptar, fortificar y asegurar los techos, ventanas, accesos y elementos externos para resistir los vientos fuertes. Los techos además deberán estar adaptados para resistir y poder drenar lloviznas y lluvias fuertes.\uf0d8\tPriorizar la infraestructura verde (áreas verdes, vegetación y árboles) y disminuir el uso del concreto y asfalto no permeable en el distrito.c.   Zonas de intervención y población beneficiadaLa  población  beneficiada  son  todas  las  personas  que  habiten  en  estas  edificaciones bioclimáticas.d.

Rain gardens can reduce or eliminate pollutants such as metals, bacteria, and toxins from entering Ballona Creek and can contribute to the improvement of water quality. Cisterns have been installed in a number of locations to supplement local irrigation needs. The Rain Gardens installed at Overland Avenue, completed May 2011, divert surface run-off from approximately 3 acres from the adjacent Culver City Middle School and High School parking area and playground into the rain garden for infiltration. The Public Work Maintenance Yard Rain Garden & Cistern, completed March 2014, diverts on-site surface run-off from approximately 1.7 acres from Public Work Maintenance Yard into the rain garden for infiltration. Roof run-off is diverted into a 3,000 gallon cistern to supplement the irrigation needs. The Baldwin Avenue Rain Garden was completed June 2012. It diverts surface run-off from approximately 5 acres of residential area into four parkway rain gardens for infiltration. The Lindblade Street Demonstration Rain Garden, completed August 2015, diverts roof run-off from an adjacent 5800 s.f. commercial building into the rain gardens for infiltration. The demonstration project was a public-private partnership and included volunteers from the local community who helped to plant the rain garden. The Transfer Station Rain Garden & Cistern is anticipated to be complete in 2018. This will divert on-site surface run-off from approximately 14,000 s.f. of Transfer Station parking and drive aisle area and a 7000 s.f. area from roof run-off into rain garden for infiltration. Roof run-off is diverted into a 1,400 gallon cistern to supplement the irrigation.As part of the Ballona Creek Watershed Management Group, Culver City collaborated with neighboring jurisdictions in the development of the Ballona Creek Enhanced Watershed Management Program (EWMP) Plan. The EWMP Plan provides a blueprint for how to best manage urban runoff to provide for cleaner watersheds through regional collaboration. It describes a compliance pathway that Los Angeles County Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4) Permittees in the watershed will utilize to fulfill requirements contained in the 2012 MS4 Permit.Culver City is implementing the EWMP through a series projects. The Culver Boulevard Storm water Median Project is a subsurface retention and filtration project.  Currently in the design phase, it consists of an underground storm water containment structure below the existing raised median that will divert storm water and run-off from approximately 300 + acres of drainage area north of Culver Blvd. The storm water and urban run-off will be collected and retained to irrigate the landscape above. In the future, it may be used to irrigate Veterans and Lindberg Parks. Excess storm water and urban run-off will be filtered to a level in compliance with TMDL’s and discharged back to the storm drain system downstream of the project. Construction is anticipated to begin in May 2019.Another project that is in the design phase is the Washington Boulevard Storm water Diversion Project which is part of the Marina del Rey EMWP Plan. This project proposes to divert and capture storm water and urban runoff from approximately 42 acres of drainage area that currently drains to Marina Del Rey Harbor. The project will be an underground system that diverts the run-off to the sanitary sewer system to be conveyed to City of Los Angeles’ Hyperion Treatment Plant for treatment. Construction is anticipated to begin in May 2019.As part of EWMP implementation, the City will also be developing a Green Streets Masterplan that will develop future storm water projects citywide.  In addition to storm water management, benefits include pedestrian safety and traffic calming, street tree canopy and heat","web_link":null,"co_benefit_area":null,"status_of_action":"Operation","finance_status":null,"access":"public","cdp_region":"North America"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[151.207,-33.8675]},"properties":{"reporting_authority":"C40, CDP Cities, ICLEI -

The City of Boynton Beach has adopted and currently enforces floodplain management regulations that meet or exceed the minimum standards and requirements for the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). The NFIP requirements can be found in Chapter 44 of the Code of Federal Regulations (44 CFR), which requires that all new construction and substantial improvements of residential structures located within the floodplain (e.g., Special Flood Hazard Area) shall be elevated to the base flood elevation (BFE), which is the point in elevation that surface water resulting from a flood has a one (1) percent chance of equaling or exceeding that level in any given year.  The BFE is the national standard used by the NFIP and all federal agencies for the purposes of requiring the purchase of flood insurance and regulating new development. The City also has its own Flood Prevention Code, which can be found in the land development regulations (Part III, Chapter 4, Article X).  While not required by the NFIP, each community is encouraged by FEMA to adopt higher regulatory standards, such as the freeboard requirement.  Freeboard is simply requiring structures to be elevated above the BFE.  Freeboard requirements for additions and/or substantial improvements require the existing building to be elevated to the base flood elevation only, which is still in compliance with 44 CFR.  New building construction however, is required to be elevated at least one (1) foot above the BFE. To verify that a building has been properly elevated, the City of Boynton Beach requires the completion of an Elevation Certificate by a professional engineer or surveyor.","web_link":null,"co_benefit_area":null,"status_of_action":"Implementation","finance_status":"Finance secured","access":"public","cdp_region":"North America"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[3.94704,7.37753]},"properties":{"reporting_authority":"CDP Cities, ICLEI - Local Governments for Sustainability, WWF","primary_source_fund":null,"organization":"City of Ibadan","total_cost_of_project":null,"city":"Ibadan",":@computed_region_n7dz_xzkg":null,"action_title":null,"population":"5591589","total_cost_provided_by_the_local_government":null,"climate_hazard":"Rain storm","country":"Nigeria","population_year":"2011","year_reported_to_cdp":"2018","last_update":"2019-12-02T09:00:04.267","adaptation_action":"Flood mapping","account_number":"36036","action_description_and_implementation_progress":"Urban Flood Management Project involving relevant StakeholdersAfforestation ProjectsRenewable Energy Projects","web_link":null,"co_benefit_area":null,"status_of_action":"Pre-feasibility study","finance_status":null,"access":"public","cdp_region":"Africa"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[11.3387,44.4938]},"properties":{"reporting_authority":"CDP Cities, ICLEI - Local Governments for Sustainability, Global Covenant of Mayors","primary_source_fund":null,"organization":"Comune di Bologna","total_cost_of_project":null,"city":"Bologna",":@computed_region_n7dz_xzkg":null,"action_title":null,"population":"390636","total_cost_provided_by_the_local_government":null,"climate_hazard":null,"country":"Italy","population_year":"2018","year_reported_to_cdp":"2019","last_update":"2019-12-02T09:07:46.037","adaptation_action":"Incorporating climate change into long-term planning documents","account_number":"36274","action_description_and_implementation_progress":"The Adaptation Plan is going to be included in other municipal planning tool such as the City Masterplan.

The past year, the team working with community groups to develop a vision plan for the space. Moving forward, a more technical analysis is underway to understand the limitations and possibilities to build a resilient park that can block, retain, and filter water from coastal and precipitation flooding.  With 40 inches of sea- level rise, Moakley Park, in combination with Fort Point Channel, becomes the flood pathway for portions of the South End and Roxbury during a 1% storm event, which could directly impact an estimated 35,000 people around 2070. By elevating areas of the park and integrating these into a flood protection berm and green infrastructure, Moakley Park can become an important component of a City-wide strategy to protect neighborhoods and critical infrastructure. In fact, Moakley Park is of particular importance to the City’s resilience strategy due to the highly vulnerable populations impacted by this flood pathway. Directly adjacent to Moakley Park are two Boston Housing Authority projects that house over 1,700 low-income families: the Mary Ellen McCormack Apartments (1,016 families) and the Anne M. Lynch Homes at Old Colony (692 families). The residents of these areas are subject to significant financial strain which would be exacerbated by future flood risks. Furthermore, Mary Ellen McCormack is in the early stages of a comprehensive renovation, and is expected to house three times as many families when the facilities are upgraded. Even beyond this development, the entire population within walking range (0.75 miles) of Moakley Park is expected to double to approximately 39,000 people by 2030 as a result of planned developments. Protecting these neighborhoods is a priority for the region and the City.","web_link":"https://www.boston.gov/departments/parks-and-recreation/moakley-park-vision-plan","co_benefit_area":"Disaster Risk Reduction, Enhanced climate change adaptation, Enhanced resilience, Improved public health, Social community and labour improvements","status_of_action":"Pre-feasibility study","finance_status":"Pre-feasibility study status","access":"public","cdp_region":"North America"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-77.0369,38.9072]},"properties":{"reporting_authority":"C40, CDP Cities, ICLEI - Local Governments for Sustainability, Global Covenant of Mayors","primary_source_fund":"Local","organization":"District of Columbia","total_cost_of_project":null,"city":"Washington, DC",":@computed_region_n7dz_xzkg":null,"action_title":"Plant and maintain 10,500 new trees per year in priority areas to achieve 40% tree canopy cover by 2032.","population":"702455","total_cost_provided_by_the_local_government":null,"climate_hazard":"Extreme hot temperature > Heat wave","country":"United States of America","population_year":"2018","year_reported_to_cdp":"2019","last_update":"2019-12-02T09:07:46.037","adaptation_action":"Tree planting and/or creation of green space","account_number":"31090","action_description_and_implementation_progress":"The Sustainable DC 2.0 Plan calls for 40% healthy tree canopy coverage of the District by 2032.

Roof replacements on existing buildings must include a cool roof plus one of five compliance options:  A green roof or green space anywhere on the site, financial contribution for off-site green space, onsite solar panels, LEED Silver or equivalent certification or enrollment in an Energy Program to achieve emission reductions similar to those achieved by the onsite solar option. The program includes options to buy community solar or to improve the building’s energy efficiency in ways that makes the most sense for that building.Denver’s Green Building Ordinance is innovative because it aims mitigate the impacts of climate change while mitigating greenhouse gas emissions. It recognizes that the best, long-term approach to building a more sustainable city is to increase green space, improve water and storm water management, increase use of solar and other renewable energies, foster the design of far more energy-efficient buildings, and embrace national standards of green building, like LEED and Enterprise Green Communities Certification.The new ordinance is improving quality of life in the following ways:•\tDenver currently has the 3rd worst urban heat island in the country, and climate change is making it worse.  Under the GBO all roofs are required to be cool roofs, and new green spaces will be created in our City.  •\tDenver will see significant greenhouse gas emission reductions from solar and energy efficiency compliance options.•\tFlexibility.

The local authorities are also working to strengthen their efforts and manpower at the respective councils’ engineering department (slope unit).” Yong also said the local councils have no special allocations to carry out slope repair works. “However, to overcome their financial constraints, they have used the allocation channeled to the Malaysian Road Record Information System (Marris) and the Improvement Service Fund (ISF) to carry out the repair works, besides obtaining loans from the state government.” Yong said this reply to Kinrara assemblyman Ng Sze Han, who wanted to know the number of critical slopes in the state and what action would be taken to address the issue. ISF is used to improve basic amenities such as roads, while Marris is a system introduced by the federal government in 2000, which records all data on roads in all states. Under Marris, the federal government allocates funds to every state to repair their roads every year, according to data registered in the system. It is learnt that since 2012, Selangor received close to RM3 billion from the federal government under Marris.","web_link":"There are 20 critical hillslopes in Selangor which have been identified to be at risk of a landslide if no action is taken to properly maintain the sites.Selangor and Federal Territories Minerals and Geoscience Department deputy director Rusli Mohamed said these were among 1,000 slopes in the Klang Valley.He said the department today presented six local councils in Selangor with hazard and risk maps pinpointing slopes that were dangerous as a precautionary measure to prevent landslides.He said the move was crucial as the department had identified several critical areas, which required attention.He said the maps could be referred by the councils to draw up their mitigation plans.“We have identified some 20 critical areas, such as in Kajang, Ampang Jaya, Selayang and part of Hulu Selangor.“The maps are crucial, especially in town and city planning to avoid any landslides in the future,” he told reporters at the Sultan Salahuddin Abdul Aziz Shah building here.Rusli said apart from rain, the other major factor which could cause landslides was that the gradient of hillslopes had poor angles.The maps were presented to the Hulu Selangor District Council, Sepang Municipal Council, Ampang Jaya Municipal Council, Selayang Municipal Council, Kajang Municipal Council and state Town and Country Planning Department.https://www.nst.com.my/news/nation/2017/09/282057/20-slopes-selangor-identified-critical-risk-landslide","co_benefit_area":"Disaster preparedness, Disaster Risk Reduction, Ecosystem preservation and biodiversity improvement, Enhanced resilience, Improved public health, Shift to more sustainable behaviours","status_of_action":"Operation","finance_status":"Finance secured","access":"public","cdp_region":"Southeast Asia and Oceania"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":null,"properties":{"reporting_authority":"CDP Cities, ICLEI - Local Governments for Sustainability, WWF, Global Covenant of Mayors","primary_source_fund":"Other: EU H2020 Project.","organization":"City of Manchester","total_cost_of_project":null,"city":null,":@computed_region_n7dz_xzkg":null,"action_title":"GROWGREEN project","population":"558700","total_cost_provided_by_the_local_government":null,"climate_hazard":"Flood and sea level rise > Flash / surface flood","country":"United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland","population_year":"2019","year_reported_to_cdp":"2019","last_update":"2019-12-02T09:07:46.037","adaptation_action":"Nature based solutions for water","account_number":"11315","action_description_and_implementation_progress":"GROWGREEN is an EU funded project running from 2017 - 2022  to support cities to develop and implement plans to become greener and better adapted to  climate change.

The activity asks several questions of its participants: What do climate impacts look and feel like locally? What decisions does the city need to make, and how can residents contribute to mitigating these local impacts? Participants then discuss what they learned, consider the various actions the city and its residents can take, and complete a survey — a critical element of the process, which helps the city of Evanston understand how residents are engaging with climate hazards and their solutions.","web_link":"https://www.nlc.org/resilience-in-evanston-il","co_benefit_area":"Enhanced resilience, Social inclusion, social justice","status_of_action":"Implementation","finance_status":"Finance secured","access":"public","cdp_region":"North America"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-78.5167,-0.2333]},"properties":{"reporting_authority":"C40, CDP Cities, ICLEI - Local Governments for Sustainability","primary_source_fund":null,"organization":"Distrito Metropolitano de Quito","total_cost_of_project":null,"city":"Quito",":@computed_region_n7dz_xzkg":null,"action_title":null,"population":"2239191","total_cost_provided_by_the_local_government":null,"climate_hazard":"Forest fire","country":"Ecuador","population_year":"2010","year_reported_to_cdp":"2018","last_update":"2019-12-02T09:00:04.267","adaptation_action":"Tree planting and/or creation of green space","account_number":"42178","action_description_and_implementation_progress":"Además de contar con mapas de riesgo a incendio forestales, todos los años se implementan acciones de reforestación en los espacios afectados, además se hacen monitoreos continuos durante la época seca ( Plan Fuego).

The Division of Water maintains and annually updates Emergency Action Plans (EAP) for four Class I dams and a number of class II dams. These EAPs include the O’Shaughnessy Dam, the Hoover Dam, Griggs Dam, and the John Doutt Upground Reservoir north of Columbus. A table-top or scenario discussion exercise is held each year for at least one of these dams, with a functional exercise held for the O’Shaughnessy dam every five years with responding partners. The Division of Water also maintains and annually exercises the Emergency Response Plan that includes each of the three water plants. This plan addresses 26 hazards, including severe weather, flooding, hazardous spills to the environment, and loss of power.  Mitigation efforts to ensure back-up power is available for each of the water plants, and portable generators are available for the pumping stations.  The Division of Sewerage and Drainage maintains and annually updates the Franklinton Floodwall Emergency Action Plan. This floodwall runs seven miles along the western edge of the Scioto River to mitigate flooding in the Franklinton area. During a flooding event, the closure of a number of sluice gates, stop log gates, sandbag gates and a roller gate are necessary to protect the area west of the river. Approximately 200 people are needed to ensure the entire plan is activated during a great flood. Depending on the river level, only a few gates may need to be installed. Three gates are exercised annually and include a number of local partners to address traffic, sandbag transportation, volunteers, etc.  The Division of Sewerage and Drainage also maintains wastewater treatment plant specific emergency action plans that include a number of hazard scenarios specific to each site, including severe weather, flooding, drought and hazardous waste released to the environment. These plans are updated and exercised annually.  The Division of Sewerage and Drainage also maintains and annually updates seven sewer and storm water Low head dam emergency action plans. These dams within the sewer infrastructure cross various waterways. The Overflow Emergency Response and Notification Plan addressing the overflow of sanitary sewage is also updated annually, along with numerous site specific Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plans and Hazardous Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure plans.   The Division of Power maintains and annually updates an Emergency Response Plan that involves loss of power to portions of the city or loss of substations. The annual exercises or scenario discussions almost always include severe weather hazards.   Each of the DPU sites located around the city, housing almost 1,200 staff members, include a site-specific Emergency Action Plan developed by the DPU Safety Office. These plans include, but are not limited to, tornado, severe storms, fire and earthquake drills.

Programa de \"Ambiente limpio” y Subprograma Cambio climático, mitigación y adaptación se deriva la acción “Realizar el programa de Servicios eco sistémico del ANP Sierra de lobos”.  La Sierra de Lobos (ANP), tiene una gran relevancia ecológica e hidrológica para el municipio, representa el principal corredor biológico natural al norte de la ciudad, existen diversos ecosistemas de plantas y animales de relevancia local, sumándose arroyos y cuerpos de agua que favorecen su captación y recarga; la Sierra de Lobos contribuye a la minimización de los efectos del cambio climático a través de los servicios eco sistémicos que brinda a la ciudad.Durante el periodo 2015-2021, se han planeado estrategias para dotar  de ecotécnias (sistemas de captación de agua de lluvia, celdas fotovoltaicas y biodigestores) a las comunidades rurales en el  ANP Sierra de Lobos previo diagnóstico y análisis para determinar las necesidades básicas de cada comunidad. En el municipio de León existen alrededor de 330 mil 062 viviendas habitadas, de las cuales 21 mil 328 se encuentran en las localidades rurales. En la zona rural se cuenta con 3 zonas de atención prioritaria, Duarte, Loza de los Padres y San Juan de Otates. De esta forma se permite fortalecer a las comunidades más vulnerables con el doble propósito de mejorar la calidad de vida de los habitantes de la zona rural y conservar los recursos naturales de estas zonas. Estas acciones contribuyen a reducir la vulnerabilidad de los grupos rurales que no tienen fácil acceso al agua potable; asimismo propicia la participación de diferencias instancias tanto públicas como privadas, como el Instituto de Ecología y la desarrolladora MDM.Durante el trienio 2015-2018, en total se instalaron 81 sistemas de captación de agua de lluvia en comunidades rurales siendo 64 con aportación del Gobierno del Estado, 8 con recurso municipal y 9 más a través de medidas de compensación de impacto ambiental. Los beneficios de manera directa: 132 familias de comunidades rurales, para un total de aproximadamente 268 personas. Durante el periodo 2018-2021, la meta que se pretende lograr es \"Instalación de ecotécnias en 3 comunidades rurales  del ANP Sierra de Lobos.

Roof replacements on existing buildings must include a cool roof plus one of five compliance options:  A green roof or green space anywhere on the site, financial contribution for off-site green space, onsite solar panels, LEED Silver or equivalent certification or enrollment in an Energy Program to achieve emission reductions similar to those achieved by the onsite solar option.

It recognizes that the best, long-term approach to building a more sustainable city is to increase green space, improve water and storm water management, increase use of solar and other renewable energies, foster the design of far more energy-efficient buildings, and embrace national standards of green building, like LEED and Enterprise Green Communities Certification.The new ordinance is improving quality of life in the following ways:•\tDenver currently has the 3rd worst urban heat island in the country, and climate change is making it worse.  Under the GBO all roofs are required to be cool roofs, and new green spaces will be created in our City.  •\tDenver will see significant greenhouse gas emission reductions from solar and energy efficiency compliance options.•\tFlexibility.

A critical factor in this context proves to be access to shadow. In parts of the city with direct proximity to trees or on the shadow side of buildings, the radiation temperature never exceeds the levels of risk identified. However, this happens regularly during summer time on sunlit surfaces, such as parking spaces, open fields or at facades in the south.Calculations of the radiation temperature are presented partly for the summer of 2014, and partly for a 2 degree warmer scenario based on the same summer. A comparison shows a marked increase in the number of occasions when the radiation temperature reaches levels that entail an increased health risk for the elderly. To show how the radiation temperature varies within a built environment, provide a qualitative basis for assessing proximity to cooling and identify particularly vulnerable environments.","web_link":null,"co_benefit_area":"Disaster Risk Reduction, Ecosystem preservation and biodiversity improvement, Enhanced climate change adaptation, Improved access to data for informed decision-making, Improved public health, Shift to more sustainable behaviours","status_of_action":"Implementation","finance_status":"Finance secured","access":"public","cdp_region":"Europe"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":null,"properties":{"reporting_authority":"CDP Cities, Global Covenant of Mayors","primary_source_fund":"Public-private partnership","organization":"Prefeitura de Guanhães","total_cost_of_project":null,"city":null,":@computed_region_n7dz_xzkg":null,"action_title":"Criação de parques ecológicos e revitalização da arborização urbana.","population":"34319","total_cost_provided_by_the_local_government":null,"climate_hazard":"Wild fire > Land fire","country":"Brazil","population_year":"2019","year_reported_to_cdp":"2019","last_update":"2019-12-02T09:07:46.037","adaptation_action":"Tree planting and/or creation of green space","account_number":"840936","action_description_and_implementation_progress":"Estudo em andamento para implantação de novas áreas verdes através de arborização urbana com plantio de árvores em calçadas, praças, prédios públicos, escolas e criação de parques ecológicos para revitalização de cursos hídricos e recomposição florestal.","web_link":null,"co_benefit_area":"Ecosystem preservation and biodiversity improvement, Improved public health, Improved resource quality (e.g. air, water), Shift to more sustainable behaviours, Social inclusion, social justice","status_of_action":"Scoping","finance_status":"Pre-feasibility study status","access":"public","cdp_region":"Latin America"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[34.344,31.3231]},"properties":{"reporting_authority":"CDP Cities, ICLEI - Local Governments for Sustainability, WWF, Global Covenant of Mayors","primary_source_fund":"International (ODA)","organization":"Abasan Al-Kabira Municipality","total_cost_of_project":"550000","city":"Abasan Al-Kabira",":@computed_region_n7dz_xzkg":null,"action_title":"Energy efficiency through ICT-driven behavioural change in public buildings of Abasan Al-Kabira","population":"31000","total_cost_provided_by_the_local_government":"110000","climate_hazard":"Extreme cold temperature > Extreme cold days","country":"State of Palestine","population_year":"2017","year_reported_to_cdp":"2019","last_update":"2019-12-02T09:07:46.037","adaptation_action":"Real time risk monitoring","account_number":"63616","action_description_and_implementation_progress":"Palestine is almost completely dependent on Israel as a source of electricity. 31% of the total energy needs in Palestine concern with electricity.

The Culver Boulevard Storm water Median Project is a subsurface retention and filtration project.  Currently in the design phase, it consists of an underground storm water containment structure below the existing raised median that will divert storm water and run-off from approximately 300 + acres of drainage area north of Culver Blvd. The storm water and urban run-off will be collected and retained to irrigate the landscape above. In the future, it may be used to irrigate Veterans and Lindberg Parks. Excess storm water and urban run-off will be filtered to a level in compliance with TMDL’s and discharged back to the storm drain system downstream of the project. Construction is anticipated to begin in May 2019.Another project that is in the design phase is the Washington Boulevard Storm water Diversion Project which is part of the Marina del Rey EMWP Plan. This project proposes to divert and capture storm water and urban runoff from approximately 42 acres of drainage area that currently drains to Marina Del Rey Harbor. The project will be an underground system that diverts the run-off to the sanitary sewer system to be conveyed to City of Los Angeles’ Hyperion Treatment Plant for treatment.

The appreciation certificate and plaque were presented by YB Elizabeth Wong, Chairperson for the Selangor State Committee on Tourism, Environment, Green Technology, to FRIM Biomass Technology Programme Head Dr Wan Asma Ibrahim. The ceremony was held in conjunction with the official opening of Smart City@Sepang Seminar and Launching of the Cyberjaya Smart City and Low Carbon Action Plan 20130 on 28 November. The seminar held at Cyberview Resort & Spa, Cyberjaya was also attended by MPSepang President, Dato’ Puasa bin Md Taib. FRIM with the cooperation of MPSepang, has successfully produced an environment friendly active ingredient for mosquito fogging called, ‘Aedes Bio Based Fuel’ (ABBF), by utilising used cooking oil. The project, led by Wan Asma, has contributed to the implementation of Smart City@Sepang and Low City Carbon Inisiatif. To date, ABBF has been used by the municipal council for fogging at five residential areas and two construction sites in the Sepang district.The use of ABBF was sanctioned since it is considered environmental friendly, as the council was adopting the Low Carbon City Framework. Even though ABBF costs a little bit more than diesel, the green factor was the result the council went ahead with its decision. The council was the first one to use ABBF in their fogging machines. Furthermore, the use of  ABBF produces less odour. The council buys used cooking oil from restaurants, hawker stalls and school canteens for RM1 per litre and turn it into ABBF that will power up the fogging machines in place of diesel. Furthermore, the programme has a dual benefit in that the programme would minimise wastage, as restaurant owners were more likely to sell the used cooking oil to the council. Typically, most food handlers will just throw the used cooking oil into the drain thus polluting rivers and affecting biodiversity too.

Improper use of the sewer system (i.e. disposal of materials not intended in a sewer) can decrease capacity along the sewer by creating blockages or contribute to pump failures at pump stations. Educating residents that toilets are not garbage cans is one way to help reduce these issues in the sewers. In 2011, the City of Windsor partnered with EWSWA to design an EnviroTips ‘It’s all Connected’ to help educate residents that toilets are not garbage cans and the impact of flushing materials in the toilet. In 2012 a video “Wastewater: Where Does It Go?” was developed in collaboration with the Detroit River Canadian Clean-Up.  The video educates about the City’s sewer system (sanitary, storm and combined) and the wastewater treatment system.  The video also tries to encourage individuals to take small actions (like downspout disconnection) to help alleviate flooding issues.  The video has over 80,000 views between the City of Windsor and DRCC YouTube channels.   The DVD has also been distributed as requested.Open houses have been hosted at both the Lou Romano Water Reclamation Plant (2015) and the Little River Pollution Control Plant (2016 & 2019).  Over 410 individuals have toured the facilities.  Tours are provided as requested at both wastewater treatment facilities.  A toilet on wheels has also been constructed to help educate residents on the issues around ‘Flushable’ Wipes.  This toilet is used at public events such as Earth Day and the Children’s Water Festival.  In 2016, ERCA also used the toilet in their Earth Day road show.  Additional advertising about the hazards of ‘Flushable’ Wipes have also been developed including ads in the Activity Guide, brochures and signage for public washrooms at City facilities.  In 2016, the City of Windsor launched the F.O.G. Cups (Fat, Oil and Grease Cups) to educate to residents proper disposal of F.O.G.  The cups have been distributed at various public events and as requested.  Cups may also be delivered to areas in the City were fat blockages have been a problem.  Staff has also developed programs to provide in schools to educate students on wastewater and climate change.","web_link":"Wastewater videohttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaXth88i7rkF.O.G. https://www.citywindsor.ca/residents/environment/Pollution-Control/Pages/Your-Turn-FOG-Cups.aspx","co_benefit_area":"Disaster preparedness, Enhanced climate change adaptation, Enhanced resilience","status_of_action":"Operation","finance_status":"Finance secured","access":"public","cdp_region":"North America"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.405,33.8889]},"properties":{"reporting_authority":"CDP Cities, ICLEI - Local Governments for Sustainability, WWF, Global Covenant of Mayors","primary_source_fund":"(Sub)national","organization":"City of Manhattan Beach, CA","total_cost_of_project":"60000","city":"Manhattan Beach",":@computed_region_n7dz_xzkg":null,"action_title":"South Bay Council of Government Climate Adaptation Planning","population":"35135","total_cost_provided_by_the_local_government":"0","climate_hazard":"Extreme hot temperature > Extreme hot days","country":"United States of America","population_year":"2010","year_reported_to_cdp":"2019","last_update":"2019-12-02T09:07:46.037","adaptation_action":"Heat mapping and thermal imaging","account_number":"59653","action_description_and_implementation_progress":"Vulnerability Assessment is done through the South Bay Cities Council of Governments.

De acuerdo al Inventario Municipal de Gases de Efecto Invernadero 2013 (IMGEI, 2013), la agricultura y ganadería generan en conjunto 220,374 toneladas de dióxido de carbono (CO2) equivalente al año, que representan el 4% de las emisiones totales.Durante el periodo 2015-2021, se han planeado estrategias para dotar de ecotécnias (sistemas de captación de agua de lluvia, celdas fotovoltaicas y biodigestores) a las comunidades rurales en el ANP Sierra de Lobos previo diagnóstico y análisis para determinar las necesidades básicas de cada comunidad. De esta forma se permite fortalecer a las comunidades más vulnerables con el doble propósito de mejorar la calidad de vida de los habitantes de la zona rural y conservar los recursos naturales de estas zonas. Estas acciones contribuyen a reducir la vulnerabilidad de los grupos rurales que no tienen fácil acceso al agua potable; asimismo propicia la participación de diferencias instancias tanto públicas como privadas. Por otra parte en zonas urbanas se implementaron acciones de adopción y vinculación de fuentes renovables de energía en edificios gubernamentales.Para el periodo 2015-2018 se instalaron 3 sistemas fotovoltaicos en edificios públicos (zonas urbanas). Actualmente se cuenta con 8 espacios  que suministran parte de su energía eléctrica a través de tecnología fotovoltaica, 6 de estos espacios son edificios de propiedad municipal que además de contar con celdas solares han desarrollado hábitos para ahorrar energía y sustitución de algunos luminarios.  Esta contribución en espacios públicos, permite que actualmente se tenga una  potencia instalada de 203 kWp con energía solar, con ello se puede lograr una reducción de 163.2 toneladas de CO2 anuales a la atmosfera. Una de las finalidades implícitas en la ejecución de estas medidas es concientizar desde el interior del gobierno municipal, entorno a la importancia y necesidad de usar eficientemente la electricidad, esto se ha reforzado a través de jornadas de capacitación. De manera directa se benefician a 500 personas entre usuarios y servidores públicos, indirectamente se beneficia al total de la población leonesa.Para dar continuidad a dichas acciones para el ciclo 2018-2021 se pretende implementar en 9 espacios la transición energética y la aplicación de ecotecnias, incluyendo espacios de convivencia y esparcimiento social, así como edificios públicos (zonas urbanas). En Pro de seguir avanzando hacia la transición energética y generar energía a través de fuentes limpias, en el Municipio de León contamos cada vez con más  espacios públicos que hacen uso de esta tecnología. En la primera etapa de este ejercicio administrativo se busca ampliar el concepto de eficiencia energética en la Sexta comandancia de tránsito  que ya cuenta hasta el momento con un sistema de recarga de autos eléctricos, se buscará que este centro de carga sea suministrado con energía solar, así este edificio se une a otros más que cuentan ya con esta tecnología. De manera directa se benefician 15 empleados de la sexta comandancia de tránsito,de manera indirecta el total de la población leonesaCon respecto a la zona rural la meta que se pretende lograr es la \"Instalación de ecotecnias en 3 comunidades rurales  del ANP Sierra de Lobos. (Total de 9 sistemas de captación, 3 biodigestores y 30 sistemas fotovoltaicos) que beneficia a 10 Familias aproximadamente 50 personas. Finalmente en zonas urbanas se implementa el Programa “Mejorando mi vivienda” el cual a proporcionado a instalaciones casa-habitación un total de 23,735 calentadores solares hasta 2019 beneficiando a 118,675 habitantes mitigando emisiones y aprovechando energías alternas, el recurso fue provisto por el gobierno federal.","web_link":null,"co_benefit_area":"Enhanced climate change adaptation, Reduced GHG emissions, Social inclusion, social justice","status_of_action":"Implementation","finance_status":"Feasibility finalized, and finance partially secured","access":"public","cdp_region":"Latin America"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-58.3589,-10.3178]},"properties":{"reporting_authority":"CDP Cities","primary_source_fund":null,"organization":"Prefeitura Municipal de Juruena","total_cost_of_project":null,"city":"Juruena",":@computed_region_n7dz_xzkg":"176","action_title":null,"population":null,"total_cost_provided_by_the_local_government":null,"climate_hazard":"Extreme hot days","country":"Brazil","population_year":null,"year_reported_to_cdp":"2018","last_update":"2019-12-02T09:00:04.267","adaptation_action":"No action currently taken","account_number":"830945","action_description_and_implementation_progress":null,"web_link":null,"co_benefit_area":null,"status_of_action":"Scoping","finance_status":null,"access":"public","cdp_region":"Latin America"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":null,"properties":{"reporting_authority":"CDP Cities, ICLEI -

Another aspect of the Programme center more on social services to vulnerable communities and residents.

Park City is working with the Thriving Earth Exchange to measure carbon content and soil health changes associated with the application. Timescale: 3 years (pilot project)Current Status of Implementation: Park City had one community demonstration event in May 2019 which produced about 50 cubic feet of biochar. Barriers to Implementation: Finding the right research partner to help with soil carbon content monitoring.Collaborators: National League of Cities (Funding), American Geological Society’s Thriving Earth Exchange (help partnering with researcher), Utah State University Extension Service (Kiln and biochar creation)Projected Impact on Hazard: Biochar will help increase soil health and water retention. This will increase the soil’s resilience to droughts.Cost: City staff work associated with the project is considered a routine aspect of sustainability work and are not included.

With the goal of informing a review of those regulations, Houston Public Works (HPW) has prepared a report, based on extensive analysis of data collected both before and after the storm. Work on the report began in September 2017. The data clearly shows that current floodplain regulations – which require only structures in the 100-year floodplain be elevated one foot above the 100-year flood elevation – were inadequate to protect homes from flooding in Harvey. While 33 percent of all homes in the 500-year floodplain flooded during Harvey, an even higher percentage (38 percent) of all the currently compliant homes in the 100-year floodplain flooded. While a range of potential new Chapter 19 regulations was studied, a change requiring new structures in the 100- and 500-year floodplains to be elevated 2 feet above the 500-year flood elevation emerged as the optimum recommendation, based on predicted benefits as well as potential costs.

Direct mail information has been provided to water customers to provide information about the status of the drought, outdoor watering restrictions, a drought surcharge, water conservation techniques, and individualized water conservation data. Water conservation is also encouraged through signage, informational handouts, and table tents at restaurants to encourage customer conservation of drinking water.  • Participation in Solano Turf Replacement Program: The Solano County Water Agency (SCWA) has administered a turf-replacement program since 2010 using state Proposition 84 grant funding that provides rebates to residents who replace their water thirsty lawn with drought-tolerant landscaping. This program has reimbursed a property owner $1.00 per square foot, up to $1,000 per project. • Water Conservation Rebates:  The City offered rebates to Benicia residents in partnership with the Solano County Water Agency, including high efficiency washers and toilets, turf replacement rebates, and commercial / industrial / institutional high efficiency toilet rebates. • Water Leak Detection: The City’s leak detection contractor, Utility Services Association, conducted their work between April 29, 2015 and August 28, 2015.
