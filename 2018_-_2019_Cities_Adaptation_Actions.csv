Rain gardens can reduce or eliminate pollutants such as metals, bacteria, and toxins from entering Ballona Creek and can contribute to the improvement of water quality. Cisterns have been installed in some locations to supplement local irrigation needs.Rain gardens at Overland Avenue, completed May 2011, divert surface run-off from approximately 3 acres from the adjacent Culver City Middle School and High School parking area and playground for infiltration. The Public Work Maintenance Yard Rain Garden & Cistern, completed March 2014, diverts on-site surface run-off from approximately 1.7 acres from Public Work Maintenance Yard for infiltration. Roof run-off is diverted into a 3,000-gallon cistern to supplement the irrigation needs. The Baldwin Avenue Rain Garden, completed June 2012, diverts surface run-off from approximately 5 acres of residential area into four parkway rain gardens for infiltration. The Lindblade Street Demonstration Rain Garden, completed August 2015, diverts roof run-off from an adjacent 5800 square foot commercial building for infiltration. The demonstration project was a public-private partnership and included volunteers from the local community who helped to plant the garden. The Transfer Station Rain Garden & Cistern, completed in 2018, diverts on-site surface run-off from approximately 14,000 square feet of parking and drive aisle area and a 7,000 square foot area from roof run-off for infiltration. Roof run-off is diverted into a 1,400-gallon cistern to supplement the irrigation.As part of the Ballona Creek Watershed Management Group, Culver City collaborated with neighboring jurisdictions in the development of the Ballona Creek Enhanced Watershed Management Program (EWMP) Plan. The EWMP Plan provides a blueprint for how to best manage urban runoff to provide for cleaner watersheds through regional collaboration. It describes a compliance pathway that Los Angeles County Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4) Permittees in the watershed will use to fulfill requirements contained in the 2012 MS4 Permit.Culver City is implementing the EWMP through a series of projects. The Culver Boulevard Stormwater Median Project is a subsurface retention and filtration project.  Currently in the design phase, it consists of an underground stormwater containment structure below the existing raised median that will divert stormwater and run-off from approximately 300 + acres of drainage area north of Culver Blvd. The stormwater and urban run-off will be collected and retained to irrigate the landscape above. In the future, it may be used to irrigate Veterans and Lindberg Parks. Excess stormwater and urban run-off will be filtered to a level in compliance with total maximum daily loads and discharged back to the storm drain system downstream of the project. Construction is anticipated to begin in May 2019.Another project that is in the design phase is the Washington Boulevard Stormwater Diversion Project, which is part of the Marina del Rey EMWP Plan. This project proposes to divert and capture stormwater and urban runoff from approximately 42 acres of drainage area that currently drains to Marina Del Rey Harbor. The project will be an underground system that diverts the run-off to the sanitary sewer system to be conveyed to the City of Los Angeles’ Hyperion Treatment Plant for treatment. Construction is anticipated to begin in May 2019.As part of EWMP implementation, the City will also be developing a Green Streets Masterplan that will generate future stormwater projects citywide.  In addition to stormwater management, benefits include pedestrian safety and traffic calming, street tree canopy and heat",Finance secured,26910000,16116204,Local,https://www.culvercity.org/live/home-property/residential-recycling-trash-services/stormwater,39860,2018,POINT (-118.4 34.02),2019-11-29T08:56:56.313,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Division of Water maintains and annually updates Emergency Action Plans (EAP) for four Class I dams and a number of class II dams. These EAPs include the O’Shaughnessy Dam, the Hoover Dam, Griggs Dam, and the John Doutt Upground Reservoir north of Columbus. A table-top or scenario discussion exercise is held each year for at least one of these dams, with a functional exercise held for the O’Shaughnessy dam every five years with responding partners. The Division of Water also maintains and annually exercises the Emergency Response Plan that includes each of the three water plants. This plan addresses 26 hazards, including severe weather, flooding, hazardous spills to the environment, and loss of power.  Mitigation efforts to ensure back-up power is available for each of the water plants, and portable generators are available for the pumping stations.  The Division of Sewerage and Drainage maintains and annually updates the Franklinton Floodwall Emergency Action Plan. This floodwall runs seven miles along the western edge of the Scioto River to mitigate flooding in the Franklinton area. During a flooding event, the closure of a number of sluice gates, stop log gates, sandbag gates and a roller gate are necessary to protect the area west of the river. Approximately 200 people are needed to ensure the entire plan is activated during a great flood. Depending on the river level, only a few gates may need to be installed. Three gates are exercised annually and include a number of local partners to address traffic, sandbag transportation, volunteers, etc.  The Division of Sewerage and Drainage also maintains wastewater treatment plant specific emergency action plans that include a number of hazard scenarios specific to each site, including severe weather, flooding, drought and hazardous waste released to the environment. These plans are updated and exercised annually.  The Division of Sewerage and Drainage also maintains and annually updates seven sewer and storm water Low head dam emergency action plans. These dams within the sewer infrastructure cross various waterways. The Overflow Emergency Response and Notification Plan addressing the overflow of sanitary sewage is also updated annually, along with numerous site specific Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plans and Hazardous Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure plans.

De acuerdo al Inventario Municipal de Gases de Efecto Invernadero 2013 (IMGEI, 2013), la agricultura y ganadería generan en conjunto 220,374 toneladas de dióxido de carbono (CO2) equivalente al año, que representan el 4% de las emisiones totales.Durante el periodo 2015-2021, se han planeado estrategias para dotar de ecotécnias (sistemas de captación de agua de lluvia, celdas fotovoltaicas y biodigestores) a las comunidades rurales en el ANP Sierra de Lobos previo diagnóstico y análisis para determinar las necesidades básicas de cada comunidad. De esta forma se permite fortalecer a las comunidades más vulnerables con el doble propósito de mejorar la calidad de vida de los habitantes de la zona rural y conservar los recursos naturales de estas zonas. Estas acciones contribuyen a reducir la vulnerabilidad de los grupos rurales que no tienen fácil acceso al agua potable; asimismo propicia la participación de diferencias instancias tanto públicas como privadas. Por otra parte en zonas urbanas se implementaron acciones de adopción y vinculación de fuentes renovables de energía en edificios gubernamentales.Para el periodo 2015-2018 se instalaron 3 sistemas fotovoltaicos en edificios públicos (zonas urbanas). Actualmente se cuenta con 8 espacios  que suministran parte de su energía eléctrica a través de tecnología fotovoltaica, 6 de estos espacios son edificios de propiedad municipal que además de contar con celdas solares han desarrollado hábitos para ahorrar energía y sustitución de algunos luminarios.  Esta contribución en espacios públicos, permite que actualmente se tenga una  potencia instalada de 203 kWp con energía solar, con ello se puede lograr una reducción de 163.2 toneladas de CO2 anuales a la atmosfera. Una de las finalidades implícitas en la ejecución de estas medidas es concientizar desde el interior del gobierno municipal, entorno a la importancia y necesidad de usar eficientemente la electricidad, esto se ha reforzado a través de jornadas de capacitación. De manera directa se benefician a 500 personas entre usuarios y servidores públicos, indirectamente se beneficia al total de la población leonesa.Para dar continuidad a dichas acciones para el ciclo 2018-2021 se pretende implementar en 9 espacios la transición energética y la aplicación de ecotecnias, incluyendo espacios de convivencia y esparcimiento social, así como edificios públicos (zonas urbanas). En Pro de seguir avanzando hacia la transición energética y generar energía a través de fuentes limpias, en el Municipio de León contamos cada vez con más  espacios públicos que hacen uso de esta tecnología. En la primera etapa de este ejercicio administrativo se busca ampliar el concepto de eficiencia energética en la Sexta comandancia de tránsito  que ya cuenta hasta el momento con un sistema de recarga de autos eléctricos, se buscará que este centro de carga sea suministrado con energía solar, así este edificio se une a otros más que cuentan ya con esta tecnología.

The study was funded by MOSTI Malaysia and the Tropical Medicine and Biology research platform of Monash University Malaysia.The purpose of this event was to educate and update the public on new knowledge regarding dengue-human-mosquito interaction and increasing their awareness of how and why dengue can be fatal in some cases. Residents of Section U2, Shah Alam, participated in a ‘Knowledge, Attitude and Practice’ (KAP) survey regarding dengue and its prevention. Blood samples looking into antibody status for dengue, chikungunya and zika virus infections were also obtained from participants.Blood sampling will continue on a 3-monthly interval over one year, with participants being updated with the results. During the study period, participants who develop symptoms suggestive of dengue virus infections, will be required to visit selected General Practitioners where free testing for dengue virus infections will be conducted.During the two-day event, trained phlebotomists drew blood from participants. 25 Monash University Malaysia undergraduate students (from the Jeffrey Cheah School of Medicine and Health Sciences and the School of Pharmacy) were involved as data collectors. A number of postgraduate students also assisted with the set up and logistics of the event.A total of 240 people participated in the Dengue Research Study.

There is a great prevalence of hard and impermeable surfaces, which detriments water infiltration and vegetation coverage in the city, harming its biodiversity, the health of its inhabitants and the economy: There’s a minimal recharge of aquifers, a growing shortage of water for human consumption, an increase in runoffs which causes flooding, loss of land and infrastructure damage due sediment deposition, a decrease of biodiversity, proliferation of urban heat islands and a general reduction of environmental services.Said problems are aggravated by climate change, which manifests itself in Hermosillo with lower total rainfall but more intense rainfall events, as well as an increase in temperatures.For this reason, the Law of Territorial Organization and Urban Development of the State of Sonora in its Article 105, established that municipalities must elaborate their construction regulations and carry out the verification of their dispositions; likewise, the supervision of water resources, sewage systems and solid waste, in order to avoid emergencies due to floods and landslides, mitigate risks and safeguard the physical integrity of people, their goods and public goods. In order to solve the problems arising from the management of rainwater (increased runoff, loss of soil, deposit of sediments and floods), the city took two approaches:-	Gray Infrastructure, also called hard infrastructure, the traditional approach around the world. It consists of drainage systems which carry water away from urban centers as soon as possible.-	Green Infrastructure, a relatively new alternative which integrates green areas with strategically designed sustainable gray infrastructure developments. It contributes to solve the problems of rainwater while fulfilling multiple functions.The regulations on climate change in the municipality of Hermosillo resulted in the publication of this document on September 27, 2018, which currently covers real estate development, construction, urbanization, afforestation, preservation of the environment, control of risks and municipal water management.

At that time, the public garbage collection service was at critical status due to the lack of collection trucks, which reduced the collection frequency. The main component of the Hermosillo Recycles is active citizen participation in recycling tasks; to achieve this, the city has developed:1. A free mobile app to inform users about garbage collection schedules and routes; it helps preventing the exposure of garbage containers on streets for prolonged times. This is possible through GPS’ incorporated into the collection trucks.2. Campaigns for the collection of inorganic materials with low degradation potential or high contamination potential (e.g. cigarette butts). The strategy involves the exchange of inorganic materials for social incentives after reaching a milestone (such as public infrastructure improvements).3. Establishment of collection spots for inorganic materials such as cardboard, plastic, glass, electronic components. The program begun with 18 collection spots established all over the city, benefiting 300 families dedicated to waste separation in the Sanitary Landfill, facilitating the commercialization of recyclable goods in more hygienic conditions.4. Separation of organic and inorganic waste. For years, public garbage collection did not require the separation of waste into organic or inorganic materials. The local government launched on July 30th 2019 a pilot program for the collection of garbage separated in organic and inorganic containers; the pilot stage included 18 neighborhoods. With positive outcomes, now several community leagues have requested participation, summing about 40 new neighborhoods to the program.5. “Our family cleans Hermosillo”. An initiative to promote cleaning days in public and empty spaces with the voluntary cooperation of the city’s inhabitants. Added benefits include improve the urban image, preventing spontaneous fires (due to grass and garbage) and preventing the proliferation of vector-borne diseases, such as dengue, zika and chikungunya.6. Municipal composting center.

The NFIP requirements can be found in Chapter 44 of the Code of Federal Regulations (44 CFR), which requires that all new construction and substantial improvements of residential structures located within the floodplain (e.g., Special Flood Hazard Area) shall be elevated to the base flood elevation (BFE), which is the point in elevation that surface water resulting from a flood has a one (1) percent chance of equaling or exceeding that level in any given year.  The BFE is the national standard used by the NFIP and all federal agencies for the purposes of requiring the purchase of flood insurance and regulating new development. The City also has its own Flood Prevention Code, which can be found in the land development regulations (Part III, Chapter 4, Article X).  While not required by the NFIP, each community is encouraged by FEMA to adopt higher regulatory standards, such as the freeboard requirement.  Freeboard is simply requiring structures to be elevated above the BFE.  Freeboard requirements for additions and/or substantial improvements require the existing building to be elevated to the base flood elevation only, which is still in compliance with 44 CFR.  New building construction however, is required to be elevated at least one (1) foot above the BFE.

Rain gardens can reduce or eliminate pollutants such as metals, bacteria, and toxins from entering Ballona Creek and can contribute to the improvement of water quality. Cisterns have been installed in a number of locations to supplement local irrigation needs. The Rain Gardens installed at Overland Avenue, completed May 2011, divert surface run-off from approximately 3 acres from the adjacent Culver City Middle School and High School parking area and playground into the rain garden for infiltration. The Public Work Maintenance Yard Rain Garden & Cistern, completed March 2014, diverts on-site surface run-off from approximately 1.7 acres from Public Work Maintenance Yard into the rain garden for infiltration. Roof run-off is diverted into a 3,000 gallon cistern to supplement the irrigation needs. The Baldwin Avenue Rain Garden was completed June 2012. It diverts surface run-off from approximately 5 acres of residential area into four parkway rain gardens for infiltration. The Lindblade Street Demonstration Rain Garden, completed August 2015, diverts roof run-off from an adjacent 5800 s.f. commercial building into the rain gardens for infiltration. The demonstration project was a public-private partnership and included volunteers from the local community who helped to plant the rain garden. The Transfer Station Rain Garden & Cistern is anticipated to be complete in 2018. This will divert on-site surface run-off from approximately 14,000 s.f. of Transfer Station parking and drive aisle area and a 7000 s.f. area from roof run-off into rain garden for infiltration. Roof run-off is diverted into a 1,400 gallon cistern to supplement the irrigation.As part of the Ballona Creek Watershed Management Group, Culver City collaborated with neighboring jurisdictions in the development of the Ballona Creek Enhanced Watershed Management Program (EWMP) Plan. The EWMP Plan provides a blueprint for how to best manage urban runoff to provide for cleaner watersheds through regional collaboration. It describes a compliance pathway that Los Angeles County Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4) Permittees in the watershed will utilize to fulfill requirements contained in the 2012 MS4 Permit.Culver City is implementing the EWMP through a series projects. The Culver Boulevard Storm water Median Project is a subsurface retention and filtration project.  Currently in the design phase, it consists of an underground storm water containment structure below the existing raised median that will divert storm water and run-off from approximately 300 + acres of drainage area north of Culver Blvd. The storm water and urban run-off will be collected and retained to irrigate the landscape above. In the future, it may be used to irrigate Veterans and Lindberg Parks. Excess storm water and urban run-off will be filtered to a level in compliance with TMDL’s and discharged back to the storm drain system downstream of the project. Construction is anticipated to begin in May 2019.Another project that is in the design phase is the Washington Boulevard Storm water Diversion Project which is part of the Marina del Rey EMWP Plan. This project proposes to divert and capture storm water and urban runoff from approximately 42 acres of drainage area that currently drains to Marina Del Rey Harbor. The project will be an underground system that diverts the run-off to the sanitary sewer system to be conveyed to City of Los Angeles’ Hyperion Treatment Plant for treatment. Construction is anticipated to begin in May 2019.As part of EWMP implementation, the City will also be developing a Green Streets Masterplan that will develop future storm water projects citywide.

This 81-acre tract of land was obtained by the township in 1996 utilizing Montgomery County open space money to fund 90% of the purchase.  Throughout the property there are wetlands, water bodies and steep slopes.  Over 85% is woodlands. In addition, the township has made significant investment to upgrade the regional storm water management system. The STC in partnership with township staff, and with assistance from DCNR, PA Forest Stewards, the PA Game Commission, the Western PA Conservancy, and the PA Reptile and Amphibian and Reptile Survey, created a master stewardship plan in 2015 to guide implementation of the township land management plan created in 2008.  Details can be found at: https://www.abington.org/government/shade-tree-commission/ardsley-wildlife-sanctuary. Two major projects are now in the construction phase, in fulfilment of this stewardship plan.1. The Maple Avenue Entrance:  Accessible Nature Trail and Forest RestorationFunded by a PA C2P2 grant, Land Concepts created a professional design to enhance public enjoyment and appreciation of the natural environment in the vicinity of the main entrance off of Maple Avenue.  Public input was gathered through focus groups held in 2016-2017.  This design respects previously-installed storm water management berms.  Project goals are accessibility, forest restoration and ongoing stewardship.  The construction project was publicly bid, and the contract was awarded to Think Green.  Key project milestones include:Removal of construction debris and clearing of invasive vines and dead trees in the area to be reforested (completed)Installation of an ADA-accessible walking path that provides a firm and stable surface to explore and view a range of habitat including new and establish woodlands, vernal pools and a meadow. The trail will be crusher stone on the flat portions, and paved surface on the slopes, to protect against forces of erosion. Rough grading took place  followed by paving, final grading and seeding.Installation of a deer exclusion fence surrounding the area to be reforested: This is necessary to protect newly planted trees and shrubs from deer browse and rubbing until they are established. Installation is about to commence.Reforestation planting includes 12 mature trees, 140 shrubs, and 70 whips that will mature into canopy trees and 70 into understory trees. Planting will be done by a mix of Think Green, STC and volunteers throughout the 2019 planting season.Habitat enhancement includes invasive plants in the vicinity of the trail, and seeding with Deer Resistance meadow mix.

The Project fully began to live when it was expanded to thermal insulation of facades and implementation of energy efficiency measures in buildings. The aim of these activities is to preserve the housing stock and help the floor owners to take care of the property they own in a better and simpler way. For this reason, the Capital City is co-financed by certain types of works, such as facade rehabilitation, flat roof repair, molar-paintwork in the interior of the entrance, maintenance of hydrant networks, etc.. The City provides 50% of the necessary funds for the realization of the activities, while the floor owners are obliged to provide the remaining 50% of the funds. The condition that the owners of the apartments have to fulfill is that they have formed management bodies in accordance with the Law. Using adequate materials, improve the general condition of buildings in terms of adaptation to climate change. Repairing all damage to the external facade and roof surfaces to prevent the penetration of water and moisture into the building using a high-quality, durable materials, installation of blinds, replacement of window frames on the facade with those of relevant energy class. Rehabilitation and restoration of facades - For this type of works, the biggest interest is, primarily for the construction of facades with the use of thermal insulation materials. In this way, it helps the floor owners, in collective housing, to increase the resistance and durability of buildings to extreme weather conditions and their consequences. In addition, the production of thermal insulation facades significantly increases the quality of housing, reduces the consumption of electricity, solves the problem of dampness in apartments, and provides a new aesthetic appearance of the building. In the long term, this is an investment that returns to the floor owners, through a reduction in the consumption of electricity, and allows users of lesser payables to provide adequate and safe facilities. Redevelopment of flat roofs - due to extreme rain and storm, flat roofs represent the problem that a significant number of owners of buildings faces and therefore this type of works are also co-financed. Training a hydrant network in the inside of the entrance - is a type of work that provides security reasons.Relevant location(s) in Podgorica: older buildings - 20 years and more.

In the future, it may be used to irrigate Veterans and Lindberg Parks. Excess storm water and urban run-off will be filtered to a level in compliance with TMDL’s and discharged back to the storm drain system downstream of the project. Construction is anticipated to begin in May 2019.Another project that is in the design phase is the Washington Boulevard Storm water Diversion Project which is part of the Marina del Rey EMWP Plan.

The past year, the team working with community groups to develop a vision plan for the space. Moving forward, a more technical analysis is underway to understand the limitations and possibilities to build a resilient park that can block, retain, and filter water from coastal and precipitation flooding.  With 40 inches of sea- level rise, Moakley Park, in combination with Fort Point Channel, becomes the flood pathway for portions of the South End and Roxbury during a 1% storm event, which could directly impact an estimated 35,000 people around 2070. By elevating areas of the park and integrating these into a flood protection berm and green infrastructure, Moakley Park can become an important component of a City-wide strategy to protect neighborhoods and critical infrastructure. In fact, Moakley Park is of particular importance to the City’s resilience strategy due to the highly vulnerable populations impacted by this flood pathway. Directly adjacent to Moakley Park are two Boston Housing Authority projects that house over 1,700 low-income families: the Mary Ellen McCormack Apartments (1,016 families) and the Anne M. Lynch Homes at Old Colony (692 families). The residents of these areas are subject to significant financial strain which would be exacerbated by future flood risks. Furthermore, Mary Ellen McCormack is in the early stages of a comprehensive renovation, and is expected to house three times as many families when the facilities are upgraded. Even beyond this development, the entire population within walking range (0.75 miles) of Moakley Park is expected to double to approximately 39,000 people by 2030 as a result of planned developments.

Homeowners installing an approved seasonal outdoor rainwater harvesting tank can receive a one–time rebate of $0.50/litre of tank storage (to a maximum of $2,000).Rainwater harvesting is used to collect large amounts of water from both rain and snow. Collected water is stored in tanks and can be used both outside and inside the home. These systems capture runoff that would normally flow into the City’s storm sewers, which helps reduce the demand on our stormwater infrastructure. Rainwater harvesting systems also save high-quality drinking water from being used for things such as lawn watering and at-home car washes. Rainwater harvesting saves water and money by lowering utility bills.To help homeowners understand rainwater harvesting system design and construction requirements, the City of Guelph designed a Residential Rainwater Harvesting Design and Installation Best Practices Manual and All-Season Rainwater Harvesting System Buyers Guide.

Roof replacements on existing buildings must include a cool roof plus one of five compliance options:  A green roof or green space anywhere on the site, financial contribution for off-site green space, onsite solar panels, LEED Silver or equivalent certification or enrollment in an Energy Program to achieve emission reductions similar to those achieved by the onsite solar option. The program includes options to buy community solar or to improve the building’s energy efficiency in ways that makes the most sense for that building.Denver’s Green Building Ordinance is innovative because it aims mitigate the impacts of climate change while mitigating greenhouse gas emissions. It recognizes that the best, long-term approach to building a more sustainable city is to increase green space, improve water and storm water management, increase use of solar and other renewable energies, foster the design of far more energy-efficient buildings, and embrace national standards of green building, like LEED and Enterprise Green Communities Certification.The new ordinance is improving quality of life in the following ways:•	Denver currently has the 3rd worst urban heat island in the country, and climate change is making it worse.

As energy prices continue to rise, vulnerable and low-income members of the community are often forced to consider whether they are able to afford the energy costs associated with air conditioning. An increase in extreme hot days can pose significant health and financial impacts for households that are trying to maintain healthy indoor temperatures. There are several barriers to the installation of solar PV systems for low income and rental households. These include access to upfront capital to purchase and install the solar PV systems; lack of clarity and trust in the solar market; and a split incentive between landlords and tenants, where landlords pay for the solar PV systems, while the tenant benefits from its installation. The Solar Savers Adelaide Program was designed to overcome some of these barriers and to encourage the increased uptake of solar PV in residences within the City of Adelaide. Solar Savers Adelaide involves the City of Adelaide providing up front funding for the purchase and installation of solar photovoltaic (PV) energy systems on eligible low-income and rental residential properties. 40 properties participated in the program and had a ~2kW solar PV energy system installed on their property.

Along with other critical infrastructure to protect the area against flooding, this work will create the foundation for a future island community on the waterfront.Flood protection in the Port Lands means that 290 hectares or more than one third of Toronto’s waterfront will be unlocked for revitalization. This next phase of waterfront revitalization will not only bring thousands of new residents and jobs, but will also provide more access to the waterfront for everyone and create a globally-significant destination where people can experience the natural wonder of the waterfront.In June 2017, all three governments announced $1.25-billion in shared funding for Port Lands Flood Protection after Waterfront Toronto completed extensive study and consultations.The project's separate components can be divided among four broad categories:Flood Protection:Bridges:Roads and other municipal infrastructure including• Stormwater and wastewater systemsParksA major part of the work that is underway is the Cherry Street Lakefilling component of the project which started in winter 2017 and will be completed by March 2020.

The EWMP Plan provides a blueprint for how to best manage urban runoff to provide for cleaner watersheds through regional collaboration. It describes a compliance pathway that Los Angeles County Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4) Permittees in the watershed will utilize to fulfill requirements contained in the 2012 MS4 Permit.Culver City is implementing the EWMP through a series of projects. The Culver Boulevard Stormwater Median Project is a subsurface retention and filtration project.  Currently, in the design phase, it consists of an underground stormwater containment structure below the existing raised median that will divert stormwater and run-off from approximately 300 + acres of drainage area north of Culver Blvd. The stormwater and urban run-off will be collected and retained to irrigate the landscape above. In the future, it may be used to irrigate Veterans and Lindberg Parks. Excess stormwater and urban run-off will be filtered to a level in compliance with TMDL’s and discharged back to the storm drain system downstream of the project. Construction is anticipated to begin in May 2019.Another project that is in the design phase is the Washington Boulevard Stormwater Diversion Project, which is part of the Marina del Rey EMWP Plan. This project proposes to divert and capture stormwater and urban runoff from approximately 42 acres of drainage area that currently drains to Marina Del Rey Harbor. The project will be an underground system that diverts the run-off to the sanitary sewer system to be conveyed to the City of Los Angeles’ Hyperion Treatment Plant for treatment.

The local authorities are also working to strengthen their efforts and manpower at the respective councils’ engineering department (slope unit).” Yong also said the local councils have no special allocations to carry out slope repair works. “However, to overcome their financial constraints, they have used the allocation channeled to the Malaysian Road Record Information System (Marris) and the Improvement Service Fund (ISF) to carry out the repair works, besides obtaining loans from the state government.” Yong said this reply to Kinrara assemblyman Ng Sze Han, who wanted to know the number of critical slopes in the state and what action would be taken to address the issue.

Además el gas recogido será aprovechado energéticamente, incluyendo el biogás del tratamiento de lixiviados.Actualmente, el Parque Ecológico Reciclante dispone de una extracción pasiva de biogás mediante drenes verticales que lo descargan a la atmósfera, se ha estimado una recuperación del 30% debido por una parte a una captación estimada del 50% y un 60% de las antorchas encendidas, dato aportado por Bioagricóla del Llano. De forma adicional, se tratan los lixiviados generados, aproximadamente 4 L/s, aunque la planta tiene capacidad para 5 L/s. El gas generado durante el tratamiento del lixiviado se ventea desde el reactor.Aunque es una opción que ha sido contemplada por la empresa concesionaria, Bioagrícola del Llano, para al menos cubrir su consumo, existe una barrera financiera, ya que la electricidad es más económica en la red. Por lo tanto se hace necesario buscar un mecanismo de financiación. Este mecanismo podría ser una NAMA de residuos de Colombia o modelos como el Pilot Auction Facility del Banco Mundial.Pilot Auction Facility (PAF) es un modelo de financiación para el clima desarrollado por el Banco Mundial para estimular la inversión en proyectos que reduzcan las emisiones de gases de efecto invernadero y aumentar al máximo el impacto de los fondos públicos y el aprovechamiento de la financiación del sector privado. En su primera fase, el PAF apoyará proyectos que reduzcan las emisiones de metano en vertederos y la gestión de las aguas residuales. El objetivo clave del PAF25 es crear un nuevo mecanismo de financiación que incentive la inversión privada y la acción sobre el cambio climático en los países en vías de desarrollo, proporcionando un precio mínimo garantizado de los créditos de reducción de carbono. Sin embargo, si los precios en los mercados internacionales de carbono se elevan por encima del mínimo garantizado, los inversores podrán beneficiarse de dicho incremento. En este caso, el PAF habrá conseguido su objetivo, esto es, estimular la inversión del sector privado en la mitigación del cambio climático, sin costo alguno. De cualquier manera, la garantía de precio proporciona el incentivo financiero necesario para realizar dichos proyectos.Desde el punto de vista de cambio climático, es especialmente relevante realizar una correcta gestión del biogás generado en la descomposición anaeróbica de la materia orgánica depositada en los rellenos sanitarios, compuesto aproximadamente por 55% de CH4, 40% de CO2 y 5% de N2, más otros gases minoritarios.

Potential smart and low carbon application :•	Convert storm water to demineralized water for industrial usage.Efficient management of urban storm water runoff can reduce localised flooding impact. Localized flooding happens when rainfall overwhelms the capacity of urban drainage systems. All the roads in Cyberjaya use conventional paving i.e. asphalt material whilst its parking surfaces use environmental-friendly permeable material i.e. grass crete. Sustainable material such as previous  pavement able to capture, slow, filter and possibly infiltrate storm water run-off into the ground, and indirectly prevent water from overwhelming pipe networks and pooling in streets or basements.Recent studies show that implementing green storm water management techniques, such as porous pavement and green roofs, is more cost-effective compared to traditional gray storm water measures like pipes, sewers, and manholes. Other green technology application that enhance infiltration, that can also be adopted includes rain gardens, green roofs, regional storm water pond, constructed wetlands and bio swales.  Clearly, effective urban storm water management should extend beyond centralized municipal storm water infrastructure to also include on-site catchment, treatment and usage.  Single-purpose gray storm water infrastructure is largely designed to move urban storm water away from the built environment, while green infrastructure reduces and treats storm water at its source while delivering other environmental, social, and economic benefits.

Roof replacements on existing buildings must include a cool roof plus one of five compliance options:  A green roof or green space anywhere on the site, financial contribution for off-site green space, onsite solar panels, LEED Silver or equivalent certification or enrollment in an Energy Program to achieve emission reductions similar to those achieved by the onsite solar option. The program includes options to buy community solar or to improve the building’s energy efficiency in ways that makes the most sense for that building.Denver’s Green Building Ordinance is innovative because it aims mitigate the impacts of climate change while mitigating greenhouse gas emissions. It recognizes that the best, long-term approach to building a more sustainable city is to increase green space, improve water and storm water management, increase use of solar and other renewable energies, foster the design of far more energy-efficient buildings, and embrace national standards of green building, like LEED and Enterprise Green Communities Certification.The new ordinance is improving quality of life in the following ways:•	Denver currently has the 3rd worst urban heat island in the country, and climate change is making it worse.

There are several barriers to the installation of solar PV systems for low income and rental households. These include access to upfront capital to purchase and install the solar PV systems; lack of clarity and trust in the solar market; and a split incentive between landlords and tenants, where landlords pay for the solar PV systems, while the tenant benefits from its installation.   The Solar Savers Adelaide Program was designed in an attempt to overcome some of these barriers and to encourage the increased uptake of solar PV in residences within the City of Adelaide. Solar Savers Adelaide involves the City of Adelaide providing up front funding for the purchase and installation of solar photovoltaic (PV) energy systems on eligible low-income and rental residential properties. 40 properties participated in the program and had a ~2kW solar PV energy system installed on their property.

Over a period of time, the need for the Subsidy Program, in areas where the infrastructure upgrades have been implemented, will decline.Through the Subsidy Program, the City offers owners of a single-family, duplex or triplex home a financial subsidy of up to $3,400 per property to install flood protection devices including a backwater valve, sump pump, and pipe severance and capping.Since the subsidy program was expanded City wide in 2006, over 40,376 applications have been approved with $48.3 million in total subsidy payments issued to property owners by Toronto Water as of December 2018. On average, the City currently issues approximately $1,600 in subsidy payments to participating properties.",Finance secured,483000000,483000000,Local,https://www.toronto.ca/legdocs/mmis/2017/au/bgrd/backgroundfile-107815.pdf  https://www.toronto.ca/legdocs/mmis/2019/bu/bgrd/backgroundfile-124406.pdf,2929886,2017,POINT (-79.3832 43.6532),2019-11-29T08:56:56.313,42,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This approach satisfies the new MS4 Permit requirement to infiltrate, evapotranspire, or harvest and use the first inch of rain. As of 2016, Metro’s National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Phase I Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4) Permit requires that new development and significant redevelopment sites utilize Green Infrastructure (GI) for post development stormwater control where possible. The design requirement is to infiltrate, evapotranspire, or capture and reuse the first inch of rain preceded by 72 hours of no measureable rainfall. Metro Water Services (MWS) commissioned this Manual to encourage and incentivize GI and LID design in Metro before its use became a requirement.

In particular, they have concluded that global warming also causes the sea level to rise. Human behaviour is also one of the contributing factors. There is too much waste in the drainage system and it is expensive to clean up and maintain. Proper development should be carried out and maintained to prevent rivers from becoming shallow.  The relevant authorities realize that Selangor needs to upgrade and build more retention ponds and flood control pumping stations to prevent flooding in the state.

Specifically, it aims to ensure that the youth are contributing to cities to become climate smart, resilient and sustainable and that the cities are committed to (have developed roadmaps for trajectories towards 1.5 degrees including mitigation and adaptation, as well as guided by solutions and visions presented by youth. This will be achieved by engaging schools children and youth as key drivers for change in influencing decision makers to make commitments and actions towards having climate resilient and sustainable cities.  The project will engage in capacity building of the youth on climate change and sustainable lifestyles and support them to develop visions and solutions for their cities. A climate council, composed of leaders and policy makers, will be initiated to give the school children and youth an opportunity to present their visions and solutions for climate smart cities with a follow up mechanism in place to ensure that these recommendations are implemented.

O Plano foi constituído de forma participativa na Conferência Municipal de Política Urbana, ocorrida em 2014. Esse fórum de gestão compartilhada da cidade contou com a participação de, aproximadamente 6000 pessoas. O conteúdo nele debatido foi resultante de planos territoriais feitos para cada uma das 9 regionais administrativas em que se divide Belo Horizonte. A nova carta normativa está baseada em princípios como o desenvolvimento orientado pelo transporte coletivo sustentável; cidade compacta; gestão da valorização do solo urbano e desenvolvimento citadino mais resiliente, sustentável e inclusivo. A cidade foi zoneada com categorias que refletem a capacidade de suporte de cada porção territorial, uma métrica relacionada à propensão ao adensamento construtivo e à necessidade de preservação ambiental e paisagística, casada às intenções de proteção da identidade e natural. Há a demarcação de centralidades para a densificação de corredores principais de transporte coletivo, assim como , mais modernamente, para adensamento das vias de ligação com os bairros. Houve maior permissão de atividades econômicas de baixo impacto se instalarem no Município. Essas medidas servem para diminuir o deslocamentos das pessoas para acesso a bens e serviços, bem como para fomento aos negócios e geração de trabalho e renda. As zonas especiais de interesse  social foram revisadas e marcadas áreas de interesse social com a finalidade de produção habitacional e de regularização de assentamentos. A gestão da moradia voltada para famílias de baixa renda é feita de forma compartilhada com a sociedade civil desde 1993 e assim continua no Plano Diretor novo.Classificações especiais são sobrepostas ao território para salvaguardar áreas de identidade notória  no Município, seja pelo patrimônio histórico ou pela relevância da paisagem. São as áreas de diretrizes especiais - ADEs que recobrem regiões onde se faz necessária regulamentação especial. Essa mesma classificação serve para a proteção de áreas com atributos ambientais importantes, porém congregam parâmetros urbanísticos mais afetos a esse objetivo. As áreas com proteção à recursos ambientais relevantes foram ampliadas no Município. Mesmo em áreas bastante urbanizadas, passou a ser exigida taxa de permeabilidade que servem à controle das águas, ao arrefecimento do clima e ao aumento à arborização. Pode ser exigida caixa de captação para controle ainda mais efetivo da drenagem. O Plano de Mobilidade foi discutido na mesma  Conferência de 2014 e, atrelado aos princípios do Plano Diretor, por ser um capítulo deste, estabelece a prioridade do transporte coletivo e não motorizado frente ao transporte veicular individual. Há uma equalização de direitos edilícios e todo terreno na cidade passou a ter coeficiente de aproveitamento igual a 1,0, exceto os em zoneamentos ambientais que, por suas características, devem ter índices que restrinjam a construção. Para elevação do potencial edilício, o requerente deve adotar soluções projeturas de  gentileza urbana - área vegetada, área de fruição pública, etc, ou utilizar transferência do direito de construir ou contribuir com a infraestrutura urbana por meio da compra de outorga onerosa do direito de construir. Os recursos auferidos com a contribuição pelo potencial construtivo adicional são direcionados para a construção de empreendimentos habitacionais de interesse social ou para fomento às centralidades. O Plano, ainda, trata da implementação de outros instrumento de política urbana para a garantia da função social da propriedade, do combate à retenção especulativa de terrenos e controle da expansão do tecido urbano.",Finance secured,4000000,4000000,Local,https://prefeitura.pbh.gov.br/index.php/politica-urbana/planejamento-urbano/plano-diretor,2513451,2016,POINT (-43.9345 -19.9167),2019-11-29T08:56:56.313,204,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

De acuerdo a este estudio, el consumo del alumbrado público es de aproximadamente el 3% de la energía eléctrica del país. Aunque estos consumos son bajos en comparación con otros sectores, actuar sobre ellos supone un ejemplo para la ciudadanía en la mejora de la eficiencia energética por lo que el Gobierno de Colombia se ha propuesto reducir el consumo de energía eléctrica en el sector comercial, público y servicios un 2,7% para el año 20155.De acuerdo a la caracterización tecnológica de municipios realizada en dicho estudio, más de 70 % de las luminarias son de la tecnología de vapor de sodio de alta presión y presenta la siguiente distribución por potencia:En la misma línea, Findeter impulsó la “Línea Especial para Energías Renovables, Alumbrado e Iluminación” con un presupuesto de 100 mil millones de pesos y que apoya proyectos de modernización y expansión del servicio de alumbrado en el campo de la eficiencia energética.Por tanto, esta acción busca optimizar el uso del alumbrado público, en línea con las medidas que ya se están desarrollando en Colombia, y tiene como objetivo su sustitución progresiva, desde las actuales lámparas de vapor sodio hasta las de tecnología LED, con el fin de que alcance al 100% de las luminarias.Es notable la progresiva sustitución de las viejas luminarias, impulsada por la Alcaldía de Villavicencio e Iluminación Villavicencio S.A., la empresa concesionaria del servicio. De esta forma ha tenido lugar la modernización del servicio de alumbrado con modernas luminarias con tecnología LED en varios sectores de la ciudad.Entre los sectores en los que se ha actuado se encuentra el Buque y algunos parques como el de Esperanza y el de Villabolivar.

Involving RM10mil, the plan incorporates three main components that will be funded by the Shah Alam City Council (MBSA). The three components include placement of seven pumps in low-lying areas including Section 13 and U1, upgrading of the current water retention pond in Section 13 and the building of two new ponds in the Shah Alam Stadium carpark. Shah Alam mayor Datuk Ahmad Zaharin Mohd Saad said MBSA submitted the proposal to the state government last week. “The plans will focus on Section 13 and U1, Taman Emas. We have already presented the detailed budget to the state financial department,” he elaborated. He said MBSA would immediately start work as soon as they received the go-ahead, and first on the to-do list was upgrading the existing pond. He said the two new ponds would be located at the weekly Bazarena at the Shah Alam Stadium while the other pond would be located at the other end, closer to the shoplots. These two locations, he explained, were the lowest points in the stadium grounds. Ahmad Zaharin highlighted that these flood mitigation plans had been designed to last for 20 years. “Drainage in and around Section 13 will be widened as well, as part of the long-term measures.” He added that the drains had been widened by several metres in 2014, but the recent floods proved it was not enough. Another critical area that will be given more attention is Taman Sri Muda, where MBSA has allocated RM500,000 under its 2016 Budget to find out the root cause of the constant flooding in the neighbourhood. City councillor Ruthira Surasan, speaking exclusively to StarMetro, said the decision was to resolve the flood woes that have plagued the area for more than 20 years. “We need to find a solution and this study will help us do that,” she said. She also said that four pump houses would be placed in Taman Sri Muda to pump the rainwater from streets into the nearby river. Long-suffering residents of Taman Sri Muda have expressed their frustration over MBSA failing to find a permanent solution. Ruthira said MBSA had been actively looking at short-term solutions for the problem, including cleaning the drains to ensure they were not clogged. “I admit that we have a problem here in Taman Sri Muda. Most of the time, the drains are clogged with rubbish. Who is responsible for that? We clean it this week and it will be full again next week,” she pointed out. She said the drains, including those at three private lots in Jalan Padu, Jalan Jitu and Jalan Mantap, had also been widened to allow better flow of water. “We decided to do it for them because it will pose a problem for others as well. We did this with the help of Sri Muda assemblyman Shuhaimi Shafiei and Kota Raja MP Dr Siti Mariah Mahmud,” she added.Ruthira said all parties had to work together to ensure the flood problem could be eliminated. Another area of concern was that there was confusion over the maintenance of the drainage system including drains, roads as well as rivers by related agencies is among the causes of floods and flash floods in Selangor including Shah Alam city.",Finance secured,10500000,10500000,Local,https://www.thestar.com.my/metro/community/2015/12/08/rm10mil-to-prevent-floods-in-shah-alam-mitigation-work-to-focus-on-sec-13-and-u1-taman-emas/  http://www.bernama.com/state-news/berita.php?id=1668924,669894,2018,,2019-11-29T08:56:56.313,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is recognised that the risk to the town will get worse as climate change is predicted to increase maximum flood flows over time.  The risk comes not just from the River Tone, but also from 3 other tributaries that flow into the town centre. The strategic solution is required to protect existing property in the town and to allow the town to develop safely. Previous studies including Phase 1 of the Scheme have pointed towards the need for a combination of (i) improved flood defence walls in the town and (ii) an area for storing flood water upstream, to provide capacity for the long term (100 years).  This work formed the basis of Phase 2 of the Scheme.Work completed to date on Phase 2 included surveys, ground investigations, initial engagement with landowners, computer modelling, initial environmental surveys and concept designs.  This work has shown the major engineering work that would be required, both in the town and in the flood storage area upstream, to provide the desired level of protection for the next 100 years.  If the major components of flood defence were constructed at the same time the capital cost would be in the order of £50M+.  The largest component, a new flood storage area and its dam, would also require a new ongoing maintenance commitment.  It is therefore recognised that the capital cost of this overall strategic scheme is unlikely to be found in the short term.The Phase 2 works to date identified a number of local intervention options that could provide a useful increase in flood capacity pending the longer term delivery of the larger flood risk reductions flood water storage upstream.  In July 2018 Taunton Deane Borough Council (now part of SWT) and the EA agreed a revised scope with the supplier for taking forward a Project Delivery Plan to include these local intervention options.The intention is that the local interventions will be complimentary to the larger strategic scheme  (upstream storage and flood walls) and are ‘quick wins’ which can be delivered in the short term to buy the town additional years protection whilst work continues on the longer term strategy and funding is hopefully secured for its delivery.   The Project Delivery Plan technical report is expected to be finalised this Summer, which will describe a suite of measures incorporating a combination of flood defences and storage.  It will include information on: •	Recommended order of delivery of the components;•	Recommended timing of delivery or “triggers” for delivery (short, medium or long term);•	The benefits of the components, individually and together;•	Estimated costs and possible funding sources;•	Potential alignment with other programmes/development;•	Authority best placed to deliver each component.A key part of the work will be to seek to produce solutions that minimise any adverse impact upon third party land.The final report will draw out if there is a flood risk change downstream of the M5.The aim is to have final draft documents by summer 2019 for targeted discussions with key stakeholders that will then allow an agreed approach by autumn 2019.  This will be reported to the new SWT Full Council in Winter 2019 for them to consider how they wish to proceed forward.",,,,,,153866,2018,,2019-11-29T08:56:56.313,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Para ello propone hacerlo de forma progresiva ya que no es suficiente con construir una planta de gran capacidad, sino que primero es necesario que se desarrollen las infraestructuras y el mercado para que tengan capacidad de gestionar esta nueva línea de tratamiento. De esta forma, se proyecta a corto plazo una planta piloto de compostaje de 5.000 toneladas al año de capacidad que trate los residuos de jardines, podas, parques y zonas verdes e incluso de la fracción orgánica recogida en grandes mercados. Por otra parte, cuando se encuentre desarrollada una infraestructura para la recogida de la fracción orgánica domiciliaria y para la venta de compost y la ciudadanía esté concienciada y capacitada para este nuevo escenario, se propone ampliar esta planta para que sea capaz de tratar los residuos orgánicos a gran escala, absorbiendo el resto de la fracción biodegradable del residuo generado.En 2040, se estima que podría existir en Villavicencio en el escenario tendencial una producción de residuos cercana a las 430.000 toneladas, de los cuales aproximadamente 135.000 toneladas serían material compostable, y que tendrían un relleno sanitario como destino final de no modificarse el escenario tendencial. Esta cantidad se elevaría hasta las 184.000 para el año 2050. Para hacer frente a esta demanda futura, se considera al menos una planta de compostaje de 150.000 t/año en el año 2040, pudiéndose modificar su capacidad en función de los resultados obtenidos con la experiencia piloto.En esta acción se plantea llevar a cabo un proyecto para compostar los residuos orgánicos a gran escala. La fabricación de abono orgánico o compost es un proceso aeróbico en el que una fracción grande del carbono orgánico degradable de los materiales de desecho se convierte en CO2 (de origen biogénico). El CH4 se forma en las secciones anaeróbicas del abono orgánico (compost), pero una gran proporción se oxida en las secciones aeróbicas del abono. El CH4 estimado que se libera hacia la atmósfera varía entre menos del 1 por ciento y unos pocos por cientos del contenido de carbono inicial del material.Para llevar a buen puerto esta acción es necesario contar con un proceso de separación eficiente en la fuente, para lo que sería necesario la implicación de los órganos administrativos, no sólo mediante el desarrollo normativo y el cambio de la política de gestión de residuos sino que llevando a cabo acciones que faciliten la operación de separación y una mayor concienciación de la ciudadanía.En cuanto a la separación en origen, se propone separar los residuos en 3 bolsas diferentes (compostable, recuperable inorgánico y no recuperable) valiéndose de un nuevo PGIR orientado a la recuperación de estos los residuos sólidos aprovechables producidos en la ciudad.",Pre-feasibility study status,32880000,,Climate finance (carbon credits),,527673,2019,,2019-11-29T08:56:56.313,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Relevant location(s) in Podgorica: older buildings - 20 years and more. Additional benefits: lower energy consumption for heating and cooling; increasing the economic value of the building; extended service life of the building; improving the comfort and health of the residents. Measure complexity: short-term measure, technically medium-complex, application depends on the financial ability. Competent authority/organization: City’s service organisations and owners of buildings.o	Due to heavy rain, there were problems with the spillage of septic tanks and contamination of surrounding land. In this regard, the sewerage network was installed in certain parts of the City. The process of implementation of the Project for Construction of New Waste Water Plant is in progress. The capacity of it will enable the waste water to be collected on the entire territory of the City.

As a result of an observation period of 52 years, annual precipitation amount has been determined to be 706 millimeters. Figure 4-3(BUSECAP 2017, pg 56) shows the amount of precipitation change between 1951 and 2005.As a result of the adverse effects of the climate change on the precipitation, negative effects such as flood-overflow and drought are emerging. Sudden precipitation changes in Bursa has caused floods in the past. The 2010 flood disaster due to irregular structuring, planning far from the scientific reality, and uncontrolled growth resulted in the loss of life and property. In order to avoid such losses and minimize the risk, it is necessary to act with an understanding of planning based on the climate change effects. According to the precipitation projections shown in Figure 4-4(BUSECAP 2017, pg 56), precipitation values which are above average in the first half of the century will decrease in the second half. At the end of the century, it is predicted that the amount of rainfall will decrease dramatically. Bursa is a city where urbanization is intense and under the pressure of industry the increase of mining activities is observed. Along with these features, particularly low-income families in illegal settlement areas, increased demand for housing, is both threatening and changing the structure of the natural values of the city. The flood disasters that have been taking place in Bursa in the past period under the influence of this situation have also caused many losses and damages. For this reason, it should be discussed whether the work carried out to reduce the flood and overflow risk is sufficient enough, and more extensive studies should realized. In order to eliminate flood and overflow risks, the infrastructure should be improved, adaptive urban transformation projects should be accelerated and river and stream rehabilitation projects should be carried out in accordance with the climate adaptation strategies.The most critical and important point is the association of the river beds that pass through the city center to the green area. A green corridor needs to be created, both for the public and for reducing climate change impacts, by creating a blue and green relationship. Considering the mid-long term rainfall regime change projections in Bursa and the development of the city, possible drainage problems and flood-overflow area management plans were prepared by taking into account the existing river/stream corridors and the urban water pattern. At present, the General Directorate of Water Management has been established and this directorate is responsible for water strategy management. The provincial organization is not yet established. BUSKI and DSİ (Directorate General for State Hydraulic Works) participated in the Water Management meetings and the Climate Change Report was prepared. All institutions are obliged to formulate a strategic plan. However, it is speculated that a budget for this will not be realized. At this stage all opinions are received. However, it is not possible to prepare a single report with the cooperation of all institutions. Hence, each institution is preparing its own strategic plan.Objective : Effective flood/overflow management Action : Taking measures in risky areas against flood and overflow risks that may arise as a result of climate events - Producing long-term solutions by considering the city's growth projections. - Preventing illegal structuring on the rivers/streams. - Establishment of urban green belt(s) by designing the sides of rivers/streams as green areas. - Selection of permeable materials in urban surface coatings. - Thinking about the passage of animals in the area to protect natural life. - Placing emphasis on river rehabilitation and pollution control.",Pre-feasibility study status,,,Local,https://www.bursa.bel.tr/dosyalar/birimek/190625113724_BURSA-SUSTAINABLE-ENERGY-and-CLIMATE-CHANGE-ADAPTATION-PLAN-2017.pdf,2994521,2018,,2019-11-29T08:56:56.313,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Promotion of zero emissions mobilityParticipation in the international project “Urban transport systems in transition to low carbon mobility (cities.multimodal)” and in the international project Fostering e-mobility solutions in urban areas in the Baltic Sea Region (BSR electric)“”.Hydrogen was produced at the hydrogen refuelling station and a successful test for hydrogen cars was carried out.The old buses equipped with EURO 2 engines are replaced against EURO 6, thus reducing the environmental impact of CO2 emissions.Two electric cars and one electric bus were purchased. As a result of the open procurement procedure, a general agreement on car delivery was concluded in 2017. The procurement procedure was conducted in accordance with the principles of green procurement.Partially completed construction work on hydrogen production, storage and refuelling stations at Vienības gatve 6/12, which resulted in the installation and testing of hydrogen production facilities and 700 Bar filling for hydrogen for private cars.Three hydrogen-powered trolley buses have been delivered and tested. In order to ensure the substitution of lower quality biomass fuels with higher quality fuels in heat production plants, JSC “Rīgas siltums” has completely switched to biofuel procurement with the payment of fuel heat content, thus the suppliers of biofuel (wood chips) are interested in supplying the highest quality chips with higher heat content.For newly built heat boilers, biofuel boiler plants are equipped with flue gas cleaning equipment, which, in addition to the flue gas condenser, will provide dust and particulate emissions and air quality indicators in accordance with environmental protection requirements.For solid particle purification, two-sided electrostatic filters or electrostatic filters in combination with multicyclones or any other effective method with equivalent efficiency will be used.To reduce NOx emissions, there will be additional selective non-catalytic or catalytic methods for injecting ammonia or urea into flue gases or another method for reducing NOx.The newly built flue gas system will be equipped with self-contained CO / NOx monitoring equipment and flue gas sampling and emission measurement sites, as well as the efficiency check of flue gas treatment plants according to the standards: LVS EN 15259: 2008 “Air quality.

Green infrastructure involves greening elements that support a city such as street trees, green walls and roofs, community gardens and Water Sensitive Urban Design. Green spaces in cities provide cooling through shading and enhanced evapotranspiration, reducing the heat island effect in cities. Urban green areas can also have positive effects for human health; flood prevention and climate change adaptation.   The Green Infrastructure Guidelines highlight public spaces and greening approaches which include Living Architecture and Water Sensitive Urban Design working together to create a more sustainable city. The guidelines also highlight a best practice approach to greening the City of Adelaide which include: • Prioritising greening in the city through trees, street plantings, green roofs and walls, within Council's existing projects and asset renewal programs • Identifying opportunities to add greening to Council owned buildings as a series of demonstration projects, including funding and staging requirements • Foster and incentivising developers, business and community uptake of greening initiatives • Pilot the greening of a representative residential pocket of the city, with a view to learning lessons that can be applied more broadly across the city. For more information about greening in the City of Adelaide visit adelaidedesignmanual.com.au/design-toolkit/greening. In FY2017/18 CoA ran a Green City Grant Program which encourages residents, businesses and property owners to create a pocket of greenery that adds to their street appeal and helps make the city’s streets and public spaces more attractive and enjoyable.

To face this risk the Rio de Janeiro City Government has several actions in place, mainly since the creation of GEORIO, the Foundation for Geotechnic, in 1966. Nowadays the City Government has a bigger program to adapt Rio to preexisting hazard that may be worsened due to climate change. This program includes actions like landslide risk mapping, real time risk monitoring, public preparedness with exercises/drills, community engagement, restrict development at risk areas, resetting vulnerable population. These actions are carried on by City institutions, like GEORIO and its Meteorology Office Alerta Rio, Rio Operations Center, Municipal Civil Defense and the Urbanism, Infrastructure and Housing Secretariat. We can highlight the “Alert and Alarm Community System”, which comprises a series of sirens, strategically distributed around the City most risky areas, that are activated when the rain reaches specified thresholds for each region. There are also designated support points near the communities, that are set to receive the population that has to leave their houses if the sirens are activated. For each region covered by this system the Municipal Civil Defense develops drills with the local community, as also has a school training program called “Civil Defense in Schools”, which gives Civil Defense training for students of the municipal education network.

Traditional varieties of rice e.g. Krishnabhog,Nuniya and Kataka are famous for their aroma, medicinal importance and fine quality grain. This ricecultivation needs flooding, and water from the nearest water source is tapped and directed through minorirrigation channels using gravity flow. A number of irrigation schemes are underway to expand the minorirrigation network in the State so as to ensure assured irrigation benefits. Funds were sourced from AIBPand MGNREGA national programs to create these MICs.Climate Change is expected to intensify the precipitation patterns and the frequency of extreme weatherevents like cyclones, hailstorms, cloudbursts etc is expected to further rise in the future. These eventsresult in accelerated discharge owing to the steep terrain and convert the mountain streams into ragingtorrents during the monsoons. These torrents if not trained cause immense soil erosion, damage to farmer’sfields and landslides as well. Torrent training (jhora training) has been provided a renewed emphasis toensure that this flood water does not cause damage and is safely drained into the larger rivers. Fundsfrom the national flagship program – MGNREGA were used by the Rural Management and DevelopmentDepartment to fund these flood control works.Being the steepest and highest terrain in the country, large areas owned by the farmers are steep andbarren and need investment to make them productive. These steep lands also contribute significantlyto soil erosion and floods. Terracing of barren land is being taken up on a large scale by cutting the hillslope into steps, providing supporting walls and levelling the land. The edge has to be often reinforcedby constructing dry stone walls about one to two meters in height. This terracing of barren land to makeit productive serves multiple purposes by maintaining soil fertility, enhancing ground water recharge andincreasing agricultural production.

Under to project well be creation of a Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan. The plan will be a comprehensive strategy for organizing the transport sector so as to meet the needs of both citizens and businesses. The plan will define, among other things, measures in spatial planning, reduction of negative impacts on the environment, solutions for public transport, cycling and walking. A particularly important segment is public transport.It is mean that renewal of the old fleet with new buses; reorganization of bus routes in terms of better coverage; modern bus stops; higher frequency timetable. Benefits: more efficient public transport. Relevant location(s) in Podgorica: Podgorica, Urban Municipalities of Golubovci, suburbs.  Additional benefits: Less need for parking spaces, less traffic load, reducing the transmission of polluting particles in the air, more efficient fuel consumption. Measure complexity: Implementation in stages. Negative external effects: Long-term measure. Competent authority / organization: Management of the Capital City Podgorica.The implemented activities so far:We have established a working group of representatives of various bodies from the city level, the ministries and NGOs.We held a three-day workshop on the process of developing the Mobility Plan and about experience of other cities. The local expert was engaged by GIZ.We addressed different institutions in order to obtain data and information which will be used for analyzing the situation.Within the working group we have named individuals who will be responsible for certain thematic areas like spatial characteristics; cycling / walking; public transport / security; institutional framework / laws / strategies; Traffic at rest/ parking.We devised activities to get to the missing data:- We organized volunteers - students to count cars on the locations which so-called “hot spots”- We have preparing a questionnaire/survey we was placed on the web site of the cityAlso we had a workshop with a broader working group. There were more than 40 participants from various institutions, non-governmental sector, business sector and etc. and we talked about what kind of city we want and we worked together on the vision of the Plan.

Uno de estos cambios está relacionado con las precipitaciones, el incremento en la frecuencia e intensidad de las lluvias. La cantidad de agua vertida ha ido aumentando con el tiempo, pero este fenómeno ha ocurrido en la misma cantidad de días que antes. En conclusión, se distribuye más lluvia en menos tiempo. Esta situación plantea un problema: en la Ciudad de Buenos Aires cada vez que llueve más de 40 mm en una hora, muchos lugares sufren inundaciones.. Además, la lluvia y los vientos fuertes pueden causar pérdidas humanas, daños al sistema de salud y bienes materiales públicos y privados, daños a la infraestructura urbana, así como árboles caídos y postes de luz que pueden producir cortes de energía. El plan de adaptación de Buenos Aires incluye varias medidas para reducir la amenaza a la población de mayor riesgo; una de estas acciones incluye la reubicación de más de 600  familias que se establecieron en la orilla del río en asentamientos informales. Además, en áreas con viviendas precarias, el gobierno  ha implementado urbanizaciones (provisión de servicios de infraestructura básica, instalaciones públicas, apertura de calles, etc.) para reducir la vulnerabilidad de los ciudadanos.

Además, se les debe dotar de recursos y se deben generar contactos directos entre los escolares y los profesionales del medio ambiente. En este aspecto se propone orientar el trabajo de los practicantes hacia esta alternativa, que en su último semestre deben hacer 210 horas de prácticas. Para ello, la Alcaldía tendría que organizarlos, coordinarlos y pagar sus pólizas de seguros. En este sentido se dispone de un precedente en el municipio de Restrepo. Tras esto se podrán buscar actividades extraescolares y espacios que capten la atención de los niños, siendo esta una forma no sólo para concienciar a las próximas generaciones sino de también llegar a los adultos. Para ello se propone crear una red entre las escuelas de Villavicencio de forma que realicen actividades conjuntas, concursos, intercambios de experiencias, visitas a instalaciones de gestión ambiental y una revista, para estimular a los alumnos.Como ejemplo integrado de herramienta de concienciación y de dotación de recursos se podrá hacer uso del programa internacional GAP (Global Action Plan), que además tiene la ventaja de ser gratuito. Este programa consiste en desarrollar en el hogar una serie de recomendaciones en torno a 4 temas (compra y gestión de residuos domésticos, energía, agua y movilidad), con el apoyo de una plataforma online. Para cada uno de los cuatro temas se explican 6 sencillas propuestas de cambios de hábitos (sin necesidad de inversión), como apagar el standby de los aparatos eléctrónicos. A través de unos sencillos cuestionarios online se pueden evaluar las mejoras conseguidas. Los resultados de este programa, desarrollado en los 5 continentes, indican que se pueden conseguir unas reducción del 10% en materia de emisiones de movilidad, un 6% en emisiones del sector residencial y un 5% del consumo de agua.En cuanto a la creación de la red, esta permitirá generar espacios comunes de reflexión, no sólo al interior de las instituciones educativas sino también en el trabajo concertado con las demás instituciones y organizaciones con las cuales se asocian, para contribuir en el análisis de la problemática, la implementación de estrategias de intervención y en general en la proyección de propuestas de solución a las problemáticas ambientales concretas, todo ello desde una perspectiva atractiva para los escolares.",Pre-feasibility study status,18000,,Climate finance (carbon credits),,527673,2019,,2019-11-29T08:56:56.313,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As a result, Lake Forest created a Stormwater Management Plan in early 2018 and their Sustainability Plan in 2016. Lake Forest’s Stormwater Management Plan provides assistance to property owners/residents during a rainfall event by helping them investigate the source of the flooding and recommending next steps to prevent it from happening in the future. Lake Forest enacted the Stormwater Management Plan in an attempt to control the movement of stormwater and reduce damage to property and protect public health, safety, and the environment. Lake Forest’s Sustainability Plan identifies the importance of minimizing the downstream effects of what enters Lake Forest’s wastewater and stormwater systems and creates attainable goals for the city to achieve over the next few years. Both of these plans help Lake Forest understand how flooding is affecting their city and begin to enact changes to help their city become more resilient to climate change events.Sources:https://www.cityoflakeforest.com/assets/1/7/2.19.19_Final_CC_Approved_Lake_Forest_Stormwater_Management_Policy.pdfhttps://www.cityoflakeforest.com/assets/1/7/LFC101_Stormwater_Bro_4Panel_v9.pdfhttps://www.cityoflakeforest.com/flooding-and-stormwater-management/http://www.cityoflakeforest.com/assets/1/7/Lake_Forest_Sustainability_Plan_September_9_2016_Plan_Commission-Final.pdf","Feasibility finalized, and finance partially secured",,,Local,https://www.cityoflakeforest.com/assets/1/7/2.19.19_Final_CC_Approved_Lake_Forest_Stormwater_Management_Policy.pdf  http://www.cityoflakeforest.com/assets/1/7/Lake_Forest_Sustainability_Plan_September_9_2016_Plan_Commission-Final.pdf,19544,2018,POINT (-87.8406 42.2586),2019-11-29T08:56:56.313,42,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was previously reported that the Wolbachia project is an innovation to tackle dengue by injecting Wol­­bachia microorganisms into Aedes Aegypti mosquito eggs. The Wolbachia-infected mosquito will inhibit the growth of the dengue virus in the mosquito and subsequently inhibit the spread of dengue virus. Malaysia's Ministry of Health ran a pilot study on the Wolbachia project in seven hotspots in Selangor, one of which was Dataran Otomobil in Shah Alam, and was able to successfully reduce dengue cases between 50% and 80%.

Rajkot lies within the watershed expansion of Aji river basin and it is a network of 19 natural drainage courses, locally known as vokdas. Unfortunately, these vokdas are being used for sewage and solid waste disposal which has led to environmental degradation of the same. Water supply depends in the first months after the monsoon to a certain degree on local water supply sources. 90% of total water supply of city is depending on Narmada water, which is sourced from 700 km away from the city and consumes huge electricity. Soil stratum in Rajkot region consists of hard rock. Moreover, the confined aquifer layer is thin. Hence, the availability of ground water for potable use in Rajkot is limited. Catchment area management and measures for aquifer recharge are potential solutions to this problem.The study of assessing potential for augmentation of local water resources through ground water/ aquifer recharge, rain water harvesting, and waste water reuse study has been done as part of CapaCITIES project, which will not only conserve rain water and improove ground water quality but also mitigates flooding impact.

Roof replacements on existing buildings must include a cool roof plus one of five compliance options:  A green roof or green space anywhere on the site, financial contribution for off-site green space, onsite solar panels, LEED Silver or equivalent certification or enrollment in an Energy Program to achieve emission reductions similar to those achieved by the onsite solar option. The program includes options to buy community solar or to improve the building’s energy efficiency in ways that makes the most sense for that building.Denver’s Green Building Ordinance is innovative because it aims mitigate the impacts of climate change while mitigating greenhouse gas emissions. It recognizes that the best, long-term approach to building a more sustainable city is to increase green space, improve water and storm water management, increase use of solar and other renewable energies, foster the design of far more energy-efficient buildings, and embrace national standards of green building, like LEED and Enterprise Green Communities Certification.The new ordinance is improving quality of life in the following ways:•	Denver currently has the 3rd worst urban heat island in the country, and climate change is making it worse.  Under the GBO all roofs are required to be cool roofs, and new green spaces will be created in our City.  •	Denver will see significant greenhouse gas emission reductions from solar and energy efficiency compliance options.•	Flexibility.

De esta forma se permite fortalecer a las comunidades más vulnerables con el doble propósito de mejorar la calidad de vida de los habitantes de la zona rural y conservar los recursos naturales de estas zonas. Estas acciones contribuyen a reducir la vulnerabilidad de los grupos rurales que no tienen fácil acceso al agua potable; asimismo propicia la participación de diferencias instancias tanto públicas como privadas.  Por otra parte en zonas urbanas se implementaron acciones de adopción y vinculación de fuentes renovables de energía en edificios gubernamentales.Para el periodo 2015-2018 se  instalaron 3 sistemas fotovoltaicos en edificios públicos (zonas urbanas). Actualmente se cuenta con 8 espacios  que suministran parte de su energía eléctrica a través de tecnología fotovoltaica, 6 de estos espacios son edificios de propiedad municipal que además de contar con celdas solares han desarrollado hábitos para ahorrar energía y sustitución de algunos luminarios. Esta contribución en espacios públicos, permite que actualmente se tenga una  potencia instalada de 203 kWp con energía solar, con ello se puede lograr una reducción de 163.2 toneladas de CO2 anuales a la atmosfera. Una de las finalidades implícitas en la ejecución de estas medidas es concientizar desde el interior del gobierno municipal, entorno a la importancia y necesidad de usar eficientemente la electricidad, esto se ha reforzado a través de jornadas de capacitación. De manera directa se benefician a 500 personas entre usuarios y servidores públicos, indirectamente se beneficia al total de la población leonesa.Para dar continuidad a dichas acciones para el ciclo 2018-2021 se pretende implementar en 9 espacios la transición energética y la aplicación de ecotécnias, incluyendo espacios de convivencia y esparcimiento social, así como edificios públicos (zonas urbanas). En Pro de seguir avanzando hacia la transición energética y generar energía a través de fuentes limpias, en el Municipio de León contamos cada vez más con  espacios públicos que hacen uso de esta tecnología. En la primera etapa de este ejercicio administrativo se busca ampliar el concepto de eficiencia energética en la Sexta comandancia de tránsito  que ya cuenta hasta el momento con un sistema de recarga de autos eléctricos; se buscará que este centro de carga sea suministrado con energía solar, así este edificio se une a otros más que cuentan ya con esta tecnología. De manera directa se benefician 15 empleados de la sexta comandancia de tránsito, de manera indirecta el total de la población leonesa. Con respecto a la zona rural, la meta que se pretende lograr es la instalación de ecotécnias en 3 comunidades rurales  del ANP Sierra de Lobos.

This action requires first of all a census of the private green areas, and secondly a dissemination activity that emphasizes both the aesthetic-cultural value of the most valuable gardens and the environmental value of private green spaces in general.Il turco association has for some years been pursuing awareness-raising policies related to the theme of urban greenery by mapping public and private gardens. The experience gained thanks to the organization of the festival Interno Verde - and numerous other educational projects and thematic conferences - has determined the will to create a significant online archive of green spaces, available to the public for free: Verde Binario.The association already has a large database, which includes about 100 gardens with relevant historical, architectural and botanical value. Verde Binario aggregates and publishes this material, creating a multimedia map open through the contribution of citizens, who will be able to enrich it by providing indications and images relating to their spaces. Here they will convoy – beyond to the information already collected - a series of materials created ad hoc, also thanks to the help of innovative technologies with which the project will eventually be implemented: virtual tour, taken with the drone and plans with  tree species and their characteristics will be indicated. Verde Binario will also calculate the amount of CO2 that the private gardens are able to absorb annually, coordinating a timely campaign on this theme communication. The platform will also serve as an intermediary for the owners of the private gardens registered and the groups and schoolchildren willing to visit them, promoting the creation of site specific cultural and social events.Particular attention will be paid to the accessibility of online content, which will have audio files for blind people and video with Lis translation for deaf people.

El biodigestor es un recipiente dentro del cual se efectúa la fermentación de la materia orgánica para producir gas. Existen varios tipos de recipientes, entre ellos bolsas plásticas, tanques de metal o cemento, que deben ser herméticamente cerrados La gran efectividad de los biodigestores se explica por ser una tecnología sencilla, de fácil construcción y manejo, y por sus bajos costos de inversión. Además permite obtener dos productos finales: Biogás que se utilizará para sustituir parte del GLP utilizado en el sector residencial, concretamente en las cocinas. Abono orgánico para los cultivos de la finca.El principal beneficio de esta tecnología para el ganadero es la reducción de olores del purín digerido y la Los biodigestores pueden ser una herramienta efectiva para mitigar el cambio climático; sin embargo, su utilización requiere de sumo cuidado, porque su función es potenciar la producción de metano, que de forma natural, como desecho orgánico del estiércol, se produce poco. El metano es un gas 21 veces más poderoso que el CO2 como gas de efecto invernadero. Si el metano producido por el biodigestor no es aprovechado eficientemente, entonces el efecto como emisor de GEI es mucho mayor a no tener un biodigestor.Se ha indicado de manera reiterada que los biodigestores no siempre contribuyen a mitigar el cambio climático y sus beneficios están en otros aspectos, como evitar la contaminación de las fuentes de agua y el ahorro energético derivado de la sustitución de combustible o, entre otros. Para que realmente contribuya a reducir las emisiones de GEI se debe garantizar que los biodigestores funcionan al 100%, con un manejo eficiente del gas, consumiendo todo el gas producido y evitando emisiones fugitivas del metano.Se estima una adhesión de los ganaderos progresiva, logrando en 2050 un tratamiento del 50% de los excretos bovinos y un 90% de los de porcinos.",Pre-feasibility study status,14001900,,Climate finance (carbon credits),,527673,2019,,2019-11-29T08:56:56.313,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Es cierto que la utilización de los productos fitosanitarios en la producción de alimentos representa un beneficio al garantizar una mayor y mejor calidad de producto; también lo es el hecho de que la aplicación de estos insumos en forma inapropiada entraña posibles daños tóxicos para la salud ya sea en forma accidental o por el mal uso de los mismos. Debido al desarrollo creciente que están teniendo los cultivos y las ciudades, los habitantes perciben las prácticas de manejo y aplicación de fitosanitarios como un riesgo potencial para su salud y el Medio Ambiente. El clima de incertidumbre acerca de los impactos de los agroquímicos se convierte en un conflicto entre agricultores y pobladores de las zonas periurbanas. Se denomina areas periurbanas a los espacios sin delimitación aparente entre la zona urbana y la zona rural. Los cambios de urbanización y desplazamientos de las zonas agrícolas requieren el establecimiento de un marco metodológico que contribuya a la comprensión de los procesos de cambio en los sistemas de producción agropecuaria en zonas periurbanas, y el análisis de sus implicancias y tendencias futuras con fines de planificación sustentable en el tiempo.  Es una realidad el hecho de que es diferente la percepción de los productores agropecuarios a las propias del sector urbano en relación a los efectos e incidencias de la aplicación de agroquímicos. Esta situación de conflicto está latente en todos los sectores y precisa ir siendo resuelta a partir de nuevas iniciativas público-privadas: una alternativa: AREA O ZONA BUFFER  (ZB) = CULTIVO AGROECOLOGICO (CA) + BORDE  FORESTAL MULTIPROPÓSITO (BFM). La interfaz rural-urbana es a menudo una zona de tensión debido a los usos  y gestión conflictivos de la tierra. Se deben utilizar zonas de amortiguamiento como barreras físicas entre otros usos de la tierra y para proveer una variedad de beneficios. Se diseñan estas zonas para minimizar los problemas.  Frente a esto se establece la creación de un borde forestal multipropósito, el mismo implica el aprovechamiento de especies arbóreas, arbustivas y herbáceas que lo conforman.

The City’s floodplain regulations are an important tool for reducing the flooding risk to lives and property in new development and redevelopment projects. With the goal of informing a review of those regulations, Houston Public Works (HPW) has prepared a report, based on extensive analysis of data collected both before and after the storm. Work on the report began in September 2017. The data clearly shows that current floodplain regulations – which require only structures in the 100-year floodplain be elevated one foot above the 100-year flood elevation – were inadequate to protect homes from flooding in Harvey. While 33 percent of all homes in the 500-year floodplain flooded during Harvey, an even higher percentage (38 percent) of all the currently compliant homes in the 100-year floodplain flooded. While a range of potential new Chapter 19 regulations was studied, a change requiring new structures in the 100- and 500-year floodplains to be elevated 2 feet above the 500-year flood elevation emerged as the optimum recommendation, based on predicted benefits as well as potential costs.

The local authorities are also working to strengthen their efforts and manpower at the respective councils’ engineering department (slope unit).”Yong also said the local councils have no special allocations to carry out slope repair works. However, to overcome their financial constraints, they have used the allocation channeled to the Malaysian Road Record Information System (Marris) and the Improvement Service Fund (ISF) to carry out the repair works, besides obtaining loans from the state government.

The radiation temperature is an equivalent temperature in the same way as the cooling effect, but instead of wind, the radiation conditions are taken into account. A critical factor in this context proves to be access to shadow. In parts of the city with direct proximity to trees or on the shadow side of buildings, the radiation temperature never exceeds the levels of risk identified. However, this happens regularly during summer time on sunlit surfaces, such as parking spaces, open fields or at facades in the south.Calculations of the radiation temperature are presented partly for the summer of 2014, and partly for a 2 degree warmer scenario based on the same summer. A comparison shows a marked increase in the number of occasions when the radiation temperature reaches levels that entail an increased health risk for the elderly.

Cook/Omāroro Reservoir. Construction commenced in April and is a major investment essential for operational security and emergency water supplies in Wellington city. This investment is also aimed at supporting the growing population in the coming decades; it will also double Wellington's water supply post-emergency from 24 hours to 48 hours.The Kilbirnie stormwater pipe  upgrade + pump station - Kilbirnie is a low-lying suburb prone to flooding and at high risk of sea-level rise. The upgrade to the Kilbirnie stormwater pipes have lifted service levels to cope with a one-in-10-year rain event at current sea levels, in line with the regional standard for new subdivisions. Furthermore, the stormwater pumpstation, proposed to be built at Evans Bay Park at an estimated cost of $8.3 million, was originally set for 2019 and has been re-timed to begin in the 2021/22 year, with the increased costs to be considered as part of the Council's next 10-Year Plan.

Ultimately, PESISIR is intended to influence policy decisions at regional, state and national levels in order to improve environmental quality and quality of life of coastal communities.PESISIR is a coastal partnership programme that was developed to promote inter-disciplinary research and monitoring of Iskandar Malaysia unique shoreline areas, including the three wetlands of international significance (Ramsar sites) – Pulau Kukup, Tanjung Piai and Sungai Pulai. The programme provides a platform for government agencies, private sector, academia, NGOs and the general public to collaborate and exchange knowledge, as well as share expertise and resources. The Partnership aims to be the Green Conscience for Iskandar Malaysia in the following ways:a. To ensure unparalleled preservation of shoreline ecosystems;b. To allow for accurate documentation and monitoring of coastal habitats;c. To ensure sustainable development of the coastlines’ long-term future and for its people; andd. To develop a model partnership that can be replicated across Johor and beyond.IRDA acknowledges the need to protect intact ecosystems to maintain ecosystem services that provide livelihoods for communities and prepare for natural disasters like flooding and tsunami. The coastline plays a vital role in contributing to continued growth of IM which has been envisioned to be a “strong and sustainable metropolis of international standing” by the year 2025. In realising this vision, sustainable development is the overarching goal that must be achieved in line with adequate protection of natural resources and preservation of cultural heritage.The PESISIR  first pilot site – Kelab Alami in Sub District Tanjung Kupang partnership model, built upon the foundation of community environmental education, engagement and empowerment, as well as citizen science approach, could be adapted and replicated in other coastal areas in Iskandar Malaysia.

The appreciation certificate and plaque were presented by YB Elizabeth Wong, Chairperson for the Selangor State Committee on Tourism, Environment, Green Technology, to FRIM Biomass Technology Programme Head Dr Wan Asma Ibrahim. The ceremony was held in conjunction with the official opening of Smart City@Sepang Seminar and Launching of the Cyberjaya Smart City and Low Carbon Action Plan 20130 on 28 November. The seminar held at Cyberview Resort & Spa, Cyberjaya was also attended by MPSepang President, Dato’ Puasa bin Md Taib. FRIM with the cooperation of MPSepang, has successfully produced an environment friendly active ingredient for mosquito fogging called, ‘Aedes Bio Based Fuel’ (ABBF), by utilising used cooking oil. The project, led by Wan Asma, has contributed to the implementation of Smart City@Sepang and Low City Carbon Inisiatif. To date, ABBF has been used by the municipal council for fogging at five residential areas and two construction sites in the Sepang district.The use of ABBF was sanctioned since it is considered environmental friendly, as the council was adopting the Low Carbon City Framework. Even though ABBF costs a little bit more than diesel, the green factor was the result the council went ahead with its decision. The council was the first one to use ABBF in their fogging machines. Furthermore, the use of  ABBF produces less odour. The council buys used cooking oil from restaurants, hawker stalls and school canteens for RM1 per litre and turn it into ABBF that will power up the fogging machines in place of diesel. Furthermore, the programme has a dual benefit in that the programme would minimise wastage, as restaurant owners were more likely to sell the used cooking oil to the council. Typically, most food handlers will just throw the used cooking oil into the drain thus polluting rivers and affecting biodiversity too.

The campaign aims to increase the county’s tree canopy and create a more equitable distribution of the health and sustainability benefits of trees across all neighborhoods. In 2016, Metro Nashville convened the Livable Nashville Committee, a group of local public and private leaders, to develop a vision to enhance Nashville’s livability and environmental quality. The committee found that, between 2008 and 2016, the tree canopy in Nashville’s urban zone had fallen from 28% to 24% (a loss of around 9,000 mature trees each year), far below many comparable cities across the country. In response to the county’s rapid development and loss of trees, the Livable Nashville Committee proposed an ambitious tree-planting campaign to restore the city’s urban canopy. Root Nashville has identified five priority outcomes for the campaign that address public health, environmental quality and equity. These priority outcomes will help select neighborhoods to prioritize in planting.•	Creating a more equitable distribution of trees throughout the county•	Helping mitigate the impacts of respiratory illnesses such as pediatric asthma•	Reducing high-heat areas within the city•	Improving water quality and reducing stormwater runoff•	Minimizing the impact of the Emerald Ash Borer on Nashville’s tree canopy In addition to planting 500,000 trees, Root Nashville will: •	Raise awareness for the campaign and the social, economic and environmental impact of trees •	Engage the community through tree celebrations, volunteer planting events, in-school participation and educational workshops•	Invest in tree tracking, watering and ongoing maintenance •	Collect data on environmental and public health benefits of trees across Nashville The Nashville community has a rich history of leading environmental efforts, including tree planting. The Root Nashville campaign aims to capitalize on this history of collaboration by engaging a diverse set of partners.•	The Metropolitan Government currently invests more than $2 million annually in caring for and growing its tree canopy. It is committed to planting thousands more trees each year as part of the Root Nashville campaign. •	The nonprofit Cumberland River Compact (CRC) will act as the campaign’s operational partner. Since 1997, CRC has been committed to the water quality and environmental health of the Cumberland River basin through stream restoration, tree planting, education and community outreach. •	A diverse mix of non-profits and community groups will partner on tree planting, public engagement, educational campaigns and scientific evaluation. An Advisory Board, chaired by local nonprofit NashvilleHealth and consisting of a diverse group of local leaders, will help guide campaign priorities and track progress. •	Private companies will plant trees on private property and provide donations, in-kind resources and volunteers•	Nashvillians will plant trees in public spaces and in their yards while ensuring the campaign is rooted in our communitiesThis action mitigates both the flash flood risk and the heat wave risk in Nashville.","Feasibility finalized, and finance partially secured",214601572,66000000,Public-private partnership,https://rootnashville.org/  https://www.nashville.gov/News-Media/News-Article/ID/7968/Mayor-Briley-US-Senator-Frist-and-Partners-Plant-First-of-500000-Trees-to-Launch-Root-Nashville-Campaign.aspx  https://www.nashville.gov/Portals/0/SiteContent/pw/docs/beautification/Trees/UFLMP.pdf,667560,2017,POINT (-86.7816 36.1627),2019-11-29T08:56:56.313,46,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Por ello, la realización de rehabilitaciones integrales de los edificios públicos, adecuadamente comunicada, puede contribuir a la sensibilización de la población en materia de eficiencia energética.Sin embargo, el municipio no cuenta con mecanismos normativos locales que faciliten la aplicación de principios de gestión energética municipal que incluyan la eficiencia en edificios, el alumbrado público, las compras corporativas o la utilización de energías no convencionales. En la Ley 1715/2014 se establecen objetivos de eficiencia energética para los edificios públicos y para tal efecto, cada entidad debe destinar los recursos necesarios para acometer el desarrollo de tales medidas.A pesar de ello, los edificios municipales del municipio de Villavicencio, por regla general, son construcciones realizadas sin criterios de eficiencia energética, esto es, no disponen de un aislamiento térmico adecuado en la envolvente, ni integran equipos de producción de energías renovables para la generación de energía térmica o eléctrica.Se plantea modificar la envolvente y aplicar diferentes medidas de eficiencia energética y energía solar en los edificios institucionales, trabajando entre otros, con la envolvente térmica y la compartimentación de zonas. Estos cambios serán difundidos abiertamente con el fin de sensibilizar a la población.Aunque estos consumos son bajos en comparación con otros sectores, actuar sobre estos edificios es clave por las siguientes razones: Demostrar una actitud ejemplarizante ante los ciudadanos, que sirva como canal de concienciación Reducir los costos energéticos de las instalaciones públicas. No existe ningún mecanismo de mercado que fomente la reducción natural de estos costos, como podría pasar en otros sectores como el sector industrial, donde la reducción de gastos es sinónimo de competitividad.Para reducir los consumos energéticos de los edificios institucionales se puede avanzar en tres direcciones: Estrategias activas de producción de energía renovable Estrategias activas con instalaciones de alta eficiencia Estrategias pasivas para generar un ahorro energéticoAdicionalmente una parte del consumo energético está relacionada con los hábitos de los usuarios del edificio, como la gestión de la ventilación (abrir o cerrar las ventanas), seleccionar la temperatura de climatización, apagar las luces o apagar el stand by. Por ello, es recomendable realizar una campaña de concienciación simultánea.Para edificios de oficinas las medidas contempladas son las siguientes: Aislamiento térmico del techo. Coeficiente de conductividad térmica (U): 0,447 W/m2 ·K Aislamiento de cerramiento exterior. Coeficiente de conductividad térmica (U): 0,45 W/m2 ·K Aire acondicionado con enfriador por agua.

While not required by the NFIP, each community is encouraged by FEMA to adopt higher regulatory standards, such as the freeboard requirement.  Freeboard is simply requiring structures to be elevated above the BFE.  Freeboard requirements for additions and/or substantial improvements require the existing building to be elevated to the base flood elevation only, which is still in compliance with 44 CFR.

Improper use of the sewer system (i.e. disposal of materials not intended in a sewer) can decrease capacity along the sewer by creating blockages or contribute to pump failures at pump stations. Educating residents that toilets are not garbage cans is one way to help reduce these issues in the sewers. In 2011, the City of Windsor partnered with EWSWA to design an EnviroTips ‘It’s all Connected’ to help educate residents that toilets are not garbage cans and the impact of flushing materials in the toilet. In 2012 a video “Wastewater: Where Does It Go?” was developed in collaboration with the Detroit River Canadian Clean-Up.  The video educates about the City’s sewer system (sanitary, storm and combined) and the wastewater treatment system.  The video also tries to encourage individuals to take small actions (like downspout disconnection) to help alleviate flooding issues.  The video has over 80,000 views between the City of Windsor and DRCC YouTube channels.   The DVD has also been distributed as requested.Open houses have been hosted at both the Lou Romano Water Reclamation Plant (2015) and the Little River Pollution Control Plant (2016 & 2019).  Over 410 individuals have toured the facilities.  Tours are provided as requested at both wastewater treatment facilities.  A toilet on wheels has also been constructed to help educate residents on the issues around ‘Flushable’ Wipes.  This toilet is used at public events such as Earth Day and the Children’s Water Festival.  In 2016, ERCA also used the toilet in their Earth Day road show.  Additional advertising about the hazards of ‘Flushable’ Wipes have also been developed including ads in the Activity Guide, brochures and signage for public washrooms at City facilities.  In 2016, the City of Windsor launched the F.O.G. Cups (Fat, Oil and Grease Cups) to educate to residents proper disposal of F.O.G.  The cups have been distributed at various public events and as requested.  Cups may also be delivered to areas in the City were fat blockages have been a problem.  Staff has also developed programs to provide in schools to educate students on wastewater and climate change.",Finance secured,27000,27000,Local,Wastewater videohttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaXth88i7rkF.O.G. https://www.citywindsor.ca/residents/environment/Pollution-Control/Pages/Your-Turn-FOG-Cups.aspx,233763,2018,POINT (-83.0364 42.3149),2019-11-29T08:56:56.313,42,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The main objective was to reduce the risk of WNv infection to the public, while minimizing environmental impacts. This program was updated in 2019 to include adaptive and more ecologically-sound management tools. Adult mosquito monitoring for WNv is unchanged from the original program. A grid of 16 adult mosquito traps are placed around the city and monitored weekly from late June through mid-September to determine the numbers of Culex mosquitoes and samples are tested for WNv to estimate the risk to the public. In addition, community education is essential to reducing WNv infection and the numbers of the mosquitoes that have the potential to transmit WNv and other diseases.The city monitors potential mosquito breeding sites for vector mosquito larvae throughout the WNv season (May through September). Sites are treated with the larvicide Bti (Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis) when Culex or vector larvae density reaches a threshold. Based on recent peer-reviewed study, the primary drivers for WNv human cases in Colorado are drought and human immunity. An epidemic has not occurred since 2003 and this study predicts that although human cases will continue to occur, it should not reach epidemic levels.

With regard to superordinate planning, the Flood Risk Management Plan (PRGA) is relevant for the Municipality of Ferrara: it is the strategic framework for flood management in the basin of the Po river within which the planning of the current basin was made to converge - the emergency planning of the Civil protection and regional planning - in order to promote the development of synergies and facilitate and coordinate the management procedures of the ongoing flood risk. As far as climate change is concerned, the adaptation actions identified for the sector of hydrogeological instability concerns: monitoring, restoration and strengthening of territorial protection, adaptation through structural and non-structural interventions, adaptation in the management of artificial reservoirs. Specific actions are identified for the Po Valley district which particularly important are the strengthening of governance actions and the strengthening of the system's resilience to deal with criticalities. The Hydrogeological Plan of the river PO (PAI PO) and the Extracted Plan for the structure of the river Reno have been subjected to Variation for the purposes of coordination with the PRGA. In urban area, the Masterplan has among its strategic actions ""water as a resource"", with these objectives: 1. Optimizing urban consumption; 2. managing water quality through interventions on drains and water courses; 3. carrying out the works of adaptation; 4. using rainwater for all non-potable uses, providing reference standards for new urbanizations. The RUE incorporates these objectives by providing rules aimed at guaranteeing the principle of hydraulic invariance, reducing the surface runoff of the meteoric waters, increasing the infiltration capacity in the ground, the reuse of gray water and the reduction of water consumption. In particular, among the measures put forward by the RUE: - due to risk of flood by Po river, does not admit in the nearby places of concentration of people with limited mobility capacity, increase in the sales area of commercial buildings, increase of the surface destined for other uses; - in areas at risk of flooding, it does not admit basements for new buildings, bedrooms a quote lower than 3 ml from the existing campaign plan; - in areas with a muddy water table, prohibits underground or basement buildings. - hydraulic invariance: each intervention that decreases the permeable surface area in excess of 2,000 square meters must provide volumes that can be invaded in case of rainfalls, or through the creation of specific containers or provision of temporary floodable surfaces. - collection and disposal of rainwater: systems for the recovery and reuse of rainwater for irrigation, for the supply of toilet flushing cisterns, washing machines, car wash, passive / active air conditioning systems have to be provided in new buildings.

However, as the project progresses, the City Government saw some opportunities for tourism and economic growth.  Thus, the City Government facilitated and provided an enabling environment so as all sectors in the community, especially the less privileged, could enjoy and benefit from it.  The City Government also saw opportunities to increase its local income, thus, constructing the Commercial Complex that currently houses 15 businesses, providing a total income from rentals to the  city’s coffer   at PhP 4.7 Million annually.  Putting into place regular evaluation and updating of the implementation of the project has facilitated the identification of ways and means for the city to explore opportunities to revise and improve its strategies so that the outputs of the project are translated into outcomes, which as of today, besides serenity and ambiance, is the additional income of businessmen,  vendors and peddlers, and the City Government.   The increase in local income of the City Government certainly means more projects and services for the Dipolognons. The following are some details about the  Dipolog Boulevard:(1)	Facilitated the following influx of investments in the area:(a)	Construction of PhP 42.0 Million worth of Commercial Complex, which currently houses 15 business establishments and regularly employing 39 Dipolognons.  Total  capitalization  of  these  businesses   have  reached  PhP 4.65 Million to date;(b)	The engagement of  40 marginal families into vending food and beverages along designated areas in the Boulevard, whose monthly gross income ranges from PhP 6,000 to PhP 60,000 per month.  The food and beverage vending has provided employment to a total of 56 people; Note:  	There are a total of 103 food and beverage vendors operating at the boulevard to date.  Latest survey conducted showed that average monthly family gross income  of  vendors  is  PhP PhP 30,000 since they engage in vending at the boulevard. (2)	Generated  income for the City Government amounting to PhP 393,000 per month for rentals of stalls in the Commercial Complex;	Also generated a tota laverage  annual income from facilities (comfort rooms) and business fees amounting to PhP 654,000.(3)	Environmental quality of the area restored.  Starting in 2013, the shore of the Dipolog Boulevard became a nesting area of sea turtle.  The City Government was able to protect and release a total of 185 baby sea turtles or hatchlings to the sea during the same year and almost the same number every year thereafter.(7)	Tourism, both local and foreign, boosted   The Dipolog Boulevard becomes a place for leisure strides, physical fitness, family bonding, entertainment for friends and visitors, and venue for events and festivities of the city.  It also has hosted some national and international events like the 1st International Bamboo and Gongs Festival of the National Commission for Culture and the Arts.  The natural ambiance, especially from late afternoon to late evening, and the clean, orderly, safe and congenial atmosphere in the area become an enticing treat to visitors and locals and the very reason to always come back to the area.In the promotion of a well-balanced urban development, the construction of the Dipolog Boulevard, has reminded the City Government to sustain the strict implementation of   Sangguniang   Panlungsod   Resolution  No.  00-1704, passed in May 2000, establishing the guidelines and providing the blueprint for resettlement entitlements of informal settlers, and the Tigil Tayuan campaign along public lands.

The City’s floodplain regulations are an important tool for reducing the flooding risk to lives and property in new development and redevelopment projects. With the goal of informing a review of those regulations, Houston Public Works (HPW) has prepared a report, based on extensive analysis of data collected both before and after the storm. Work on the report began in September 2017. The data clearly shows that current floodplain regulations – which require only structures in the 100-year floodplain be elevated one foot above the 100-year flood elevation – were inadequate to protect homes from flooding in Harvey. While 33 percent of all homes in the 500-year floodplain flooded during Harvey, an even higher percentage (38 percent) of all the currently compliant homes in the 100-year floodplain flooded. While a range of potential new Chapter 19 regulations was studied, a change requiring new structures in the 100- and 500-year floodplains to be elevated 2 feet above the 500-year flood elevation emerged as the optimum recommendation, based on predicted benefits as well as potential costs.

Consiste en la siembra de plantas, generalmente de especies forrajeras gramíneas, leguminosas o crucíferas, que no se destinan al pastoreo animal ni a la cosecha de granos. Se siembran en otoño y ocupan el suelo entre dos cultivos de verano.Su incorporación contribuye a retener la humedad en el suelo, aumentando la penetración de agua y reduciendo la pérdida por escorrentía, se aprovechan mejor los nutrientes que son liberados para el cultivo de grano y se controlan las malezas de difícil eliminación con herbicidas.Uno de los importantes beneficios de los cultivos de cobertura es que muchas especies de leguminosas tienen la capacidad de fijar nitrógeno atmosférico y pueden ayudar a mejorar la fertilidad del suelo. Al incorporar estas coberturas, se necesitan menos fertilizantes nitrogenados para suplir los requerimientos del cultivo y esto, además de ser un ahorro importante para el productor, es una contribución importante a la mitigación de los gases de efecto invernadero (GEI).También hay que destacar que dentro de las posibles alternativas de adaptación a un incremento en la temperatura por el cambio climático (olas de calor, noches más calurosas) puede señalarse la utilización de cultivos con mayor tolerancia al estrés térmico, así como el ajuste de la fecha de siembra y el ciclo de los cultivos para ubicar los periodos críticos de definición del rendimiento en momentos de menor riesgo.",Pre-feasibility study status,,,,,10292,2010,,2019-11-29T08:56:56.313,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is a project that represents a set of systematic information and data on green areas, their quantity, quality and spatial distribution. The goal of developing the cadastre of greenery is the better planning and preserved greenery and systematic raising of new green areas as an oasis for recreation and using by the citizens in the our city. It is mean detailed records of green areas and maintenance units, facilitated planning and implementation of maintenance of public green spaces. Relevant location(s) in Podgorica: all public green spaces. Additional benefits: reduced maintenance costs; higher quality maintenance of green areas. Measure complexity: medium-term. The first step was to digitize one the city park. For the remaining greenery areas, we have developed the project task and public call.In addition, the project ""My Tree"" was launched. Under that project  with the support of citizens and socially responsible entities, tree seedlings were planted in several locations. In cooperation with NGOs, afforestation actions were organized, to seedlings planted of 900 pieces of trees. In the framework of the project ""Active youth for a better environment"", an action was taken on the planting of evergreen and deciduous seedlings in the park-forest Gorica and Zlatička Forest. Furthermore, in various activities, was planting more than 200 seedlings of trees in different parts of the city. In addition the existing green areas in the city are also maintained.All this increases the resilience of the city and raises the level of quality of life in extreme climatic conditions.Also City has implemented measure Light-colored facades and anti-reflection coatings.  The measure which is affected by the choice of material to heat the building due to the effect of sun rays. By choosing bright colors for painting the facade, as well as the application of reflective coatings for protecting roof insulation, a significantly lower degree of heat in the building is achieved during the summer period. Measure implemented in the center of Podgorica which is identified as a „hot island”. Additional benefits: Lower energy consumption for cooling; greater color stability, and therefore lower maintenance costs; brighter colors are cheaper than the dark ones; using anti-reflection coatings the life of waterproofing layers is prolonged and maintenance costs are reduced.One of the measures we are implementing is renovation of hospitals, kindergartens, schools and other social infrastructure.  We are developing green areas around hospitals, kindergartens etc.; painting in brighter colors, installation of insulation for indoor cooling and heating.

Green infrastructure involves greening elements that support a city such as street trees, green walls and roofs, community gardens and Water Sensitive Urban Design. Green spaces in cities provide cooling through shading and enhanced evapotranspiration, reducing the heat island effect in cities. Urban green areas can also have positive effects for human health; flood prevention and climate change adaptation. The Green Infrastructure Guidelines highlight public spaces and greening approaches which include Living Architecture and Water Sensitive Urban Design working together to create a more sustainable city. The guidelines also highlight a best practice approach to greening the City of Adelaide which include: • Prioritising greening in the city through trees, street plantings, green roofs and walls, within Council's existing projects and asset renewal programs • Identifying opportunities to add greening to Council owned buildings as a series of demonstration projects, including funding and staging requirements • Foster and incentivising developers, business and community uptake of greening initiatives • Pilot the greening of a representative residential pocket of the city, with a view to learning lessons that can be applied more broadly across the city. For more information about greening in the City of Adelaide visit adelaidedesignmanual.com.au/design-toolkit/greening.Targets for increasing canopy cover in the CBD and North Adelaide to 25% and 40% respectively by 2040 (based on current levels of 14.3% and 28.2%).  Our Strategic Commitment by 2020 was to increase street trees in built-up areas to 1,000, however in mid-2018 this was surpassed, and Council agreed to increase the target to 1,500. Green space and greenery in the public realm have increased by 26,666 square metres, with 73,334 square metres remaining to reach our strategic goal of 100,000 square metres.Council also approved the update to the Adelaide Design Manual which included a revised palette of street trees and understory plantings. Currently a Green City Implementation Plan is being developed to inform rolling three-year capital works program, with the intent of ensuring progressive improvements and prioritising tree planting projects in the city. The Green City Grant program ran in FY 2017/18 allocated $150,000 to 23 projects through the program, including window boxes on heritage listed buildings, small green walls in small food places and two significant green walls.","Feasibility finalized, and finance partially secured",800000,800000,Local,http://www.adelaidedesignmanual.com.au/design-toolkit/greening,27247,2019,POINT (138.601 -34.9285),2019-11-29T08:56:56.313,228,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Não é difícil saber porque isso acontece.A RMSP está situada sobre um planalto com baixos declives e é talvez a área mais densamente ocupada no mundo. Ao longo do tempo essa ocupação foi feita de forma desordenada e desprovida de planejamento urbano. O processo de urbanização que ocorreu a partir dos anos 60 trouxe como conseqüência a impermeabilização do solo; todo espaço retirado pela urbanização, antes destinado ao armazenamento natural das águas, ou seja, as várzeas dos cursos d'água, foram substituídas por novas áreas inundáveis. Acrescenta-se a esse problema a prática de canalizações dos rios e córregos, muitas vezes de forma radical, alterando o comportamento das enchentes e não resolvendo o problema, uma vez que a cidade continua crescendo sem planejamento, exigindo cada vez mais medidas para disciplinar e conter as águas.Visando primordialmente o combate às enchentes na Região Metropolitana de São Paulo, através de uma abordagem integrada dos problemas em todas as principais sub-bacias da bacia hidrográfica do Alto Tietê, em 1998 foi elaborado o Plano Diretor de Macrodrenagem da bacia do alto Tietê, que busca complementar as necessárias obras de melhoria hidráulica dos rios Tietê e Tamanduateí com um conjunto de soluções modulares, por sub-bacias, que permitem a execução por etapas O Plano Diretor de Macrodrenagem visa, em síntese, diagnosticar os problemas existentes ou previstos no horizonte de projeto a determinar, do ponto de vista técnico-econômico e ambiental, as soluções mais interessantes.

For example, Austin HSEM and Travis County OEM provided bottled and bulk drinking water to community facilities but, in some cases, the facilities were unsure of how to process the water and which format (bottled or bulk) would best serve their needs. This raises the need to understand how critical facilities receive water and energy, and how to service those facilities during a major event. In order to better prepare for hazards and threats and be more adaptable to a changing climate, Homeland Security Emergency Management (HSEM) and the City of Austin departments plan to analyze a critical facility’s water and energy needs with the goal to provide continuous services during and after a major event. The phase of this plan is to pilot an analysis with City of Austin-owned facilities. The 2018 Colorado River flooding highlighted the importance of better understanding the water and electrical needs at critical facilities, and it is imperative that this work is done before the next major event.

The new standards demand higher energy efficiency, re-naturalization and de-pavement (including green roofs), and the certification of CO2 reduction. Moreover, the article comprises specific services and advice programs that are activated in case of heatwave events (expected or underway). The Master Plan furthermore provides strategic objectives and measurable indicators of progress. Of the five main objectives which drive Milan’s 2030 Plan, it is to be highlighted Objective 3: “A green, livable and resilient city.” Top initiatives in this section include restoring and consolidating a series of underutilized public and private spaces into ecological corridors, as well as incentivizing the environmental sustainability of existing and new construction through the introduction of new buildings standards.Sustainability and resilience are at the center of the vision for future Milan. Compared to current regulations, the new city plan provides for the reduction of land consumption by 4% – made possible by a unique approach corralling over 3 million square meters previously zoned for agricultural use or new construction. The Milan 2030 strategy envisions the creation of a consolidated Metropolitan Park, connecting all existing parks, as well as the city’s fragmented network of public and private spaces, into ecological corridors. Overall, the city of 2030 will boast 20 new parks larger than 1 hectare. The redevelopment of Milan’s railyards will open up an additional 65 hectares of green space, which will not only house the city’s third largest park at Scalo Farini, but will also be the structure of “Green Track” – a new ecological system that is developing along the railway, partially financed by the European CLEVER Cities project.Milan’s regeneration, far from being solely focused on the changing skyline, already embraces public space as a fundamental common good. Interventions on public squares both large and small are being undertaken with the aim of strengthening local neighborhood identities, favoring walkability, increasing green space, and supporting local shops and tourism. They favor safety, cohesion, and social inclusion, building off of widespread services which are designed in particular for young people, the elderly, and the most fragile sections of the population.",Feasibility undertaken,,,Local,https://www.pgt.comune.milano.it/,1395274,2018,POINT (9.08635 45.8026),2019-11-29T08:56:56.313,50,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Estudios de Contaminación de Lagunas Subsidiarias: los muestreos de las lagunas se realizaron desde setiembre de 2009 hasta diciembre de 2015. Según los indicadores de calidad hídrica, los resultados analíticos confirman la contaminación de las lagunas con líquidos residuales. Las concentraciones de indicadores de contaminación como DQO, DBO y los bajos niveles de oxígeno disuelto, además de la elevada concentración de coliformes, revelan las zonas de mayores aportes de líquidos residuales. Los asentamientos en las márgenes de las lagunas generan un incremento del grado de contaminación, por ello sería deseable reubicar esas familias en zonas más adecuadas donde tengan acceso a agua potable y servicios. La presencia de altos recuentos de bacterias coliformes provoca un alto impacto en los niveles de contaminación de las lagunas. 2. Limpieza: mediante la utilización de maquinarias anfibia y palas flotantes (máquina tipo retroexcavadora sobre pontones llamada carpinchera), se produce la extracción mecánica de las especies botánicas flotantes , depositándolas en la costa o ribera, para el secado y posterior carga en camiones de traslado hasta el Vivero Municipal como materia prima para la producción de compost (en mezcla con suelo y abonos orgánicos). Asimismo, se utiliza maquinaria para profundizar el lecho, de tal forma de incrementar la capacidad de recepción del agua de escurrimiento por precipitaciones pluviales. 3. Monitoreo de la Calidad del Agua: mediante un Convenio con la Universidad Tecnológica Nacional Regional Resistencia, Facultad de Ingeniería Química, Departamento Laboratorio Analítico, se realizarán trimestralmente los muestreos y análisis de la calidad del agua en 55 puntos de muestreo, dispuestos en el río Negro y las Lagunas Subsidiarias. De esta forma, se monitoreará la evolución de los parámetros físicoquímicos y biológicos, en correlación con la limpieza y recuperación de los recursos hídricos proyectados. Es sumamente importante poder tener una frecuencia trimestral y vigilancia permanente de estos parámetros, dado que son indicadores del resultado de aplicación de los componentes Fiscalización y Educación. 4. Fiscalización y Cierre de las descargas cloacales ilegales: mediante la firma de un Convenio de Cooperación con la Empresa del Estado Provincial encargada del saneamiento ambiental (SAMEEP), se pondrá en marcha un equipo de técnicos que recorrerá las urbanizaciones y asentamientos en la ribera del río Negro y de las Lagunas. Los complejos urbanísticos de clase alta, media-alta y media, serán fiscalizados e intimados a conectarse a la red secundaria de efluentes cloacales, con la aplicación de fuertes multas por el incumplimiento de la legislación vigente en la materia. Los asentamientos de clase baja o villas de emergencia, serán abordados desde la educación ambiental, profundizando en la temática de gestión de los residuos domiciliarios e impermeabilización de sus pozos negros. 5. Plan de Educación Ambiental: es el componente más importante de todo el proyecto, puesto que es el motor para la reducción de los valores contaminantes de las aguas tanto del río como de las lagunas. Las poblaciones ribereñas deberán tomar conciencia del valor del recurso que poseen en forma perimetral, junto con el resto de la sociedad de Resistencia, que deberá dejar de darle la “espalda” a sus recursos hídricos y ponerse de frente ante una fuente de vida y biodiversidad, necesaria para esta y las demás generaciones venideras.

Não é difícil saber porque isso acontece.A RMSP está situada sobre um planalto com baixos declives e é talvez a área mais densamente ocupada no mundo. Ao longo do tempo essa ocupação foi feita de forma desordenada e desprovida de planejamento urbano. O processo de urbanização que ocorreu a partir dos anos 60 trouxe como conseqüência a impermeabilização do solo; todo espaço retirado pela urbanização, antes destinado ao armazenamento natural das águas, ou seja, as várzeas dos cursos d'água, foram substituídas por novas áreas inundáveis. Acrescenta-se a esse problema a prática de canalizações dos rios e córregos, muitas vezes de forma radical, alterando o comportamento das enchentes e não resolvendo o problema, uma vez que a cidade continua crescendo sem planejamento, exigindo cada vez mais medidas para disciplinar e conter as águas.Visando primordialmente o combate às enchentes na Região Metropolitana de São Paulo, através de uma abordagem integrada dos problemas em todas as principais sub-bacias da bacia hidrográfica do Alto Tietê, em 1998 foi elaborado o Plano Diretor de Macrodrenagem da bacia do alto Tietê, que busca complementar as necessárias obras de melhoria hidráulica dos rios Tietê e Tamanduateí com um conjunto de soluções modulares, por sub-bacias, que permitem a execução por etapas O Plano Diretor de Macrodrenagem visa, em síntese, diagnosticar os problemas existentes ou previstos no horizonte de projeto a determinar, do ponto de vista técnico-econômico e ambiental, as soluções mais interessantes. Em sua estruturação atual contempla soluções para as seguintes bacias:Bacia do Rio Tamanduateí, aqui incluídas as sub-bacias dos Ribeirões dos Meninos e Couros e do Córrego do Oratório; Bacia do Córrego Pirajuçara; Bacia do Rio Aricanduva e Calha do Rio Tietê; Bacia do Ribeirão Vermelho;  Bacia do Médio Juqueri; Bacia do Rio Baquirivu.No Plano de Metas 2019-2020 O objetivo 9 é: Reduzir em 12,6% (2,77 km²) as áreas inundáveis,  realizando um conjunto de intervenções e obras para controle de cheias nas bacias hidrográficas do município de São Paulo. O orçamento próprio previsto é de R$ 609,9 milhões e de R$ 378,5 milhões de outros recursos, envolvem obras de macrodrenagem nas seguintes Bacias:Bacia do Ribeirão Aricanduva; Riacho do Ipiranga; Bacia do Córrego Zavuvus; Córrego Tremembé; Córrego Paciência; Programa de Redução de Alagamentos; obras de macrodrenagem na Bacia do Córrego Uberaba; Bacia do Córrego Perus; Bacia do Córrego Mooca; Bacia do Córrego Freitas; Bacia do Córrego Mirassol; obras de macrodrenagem em parceria com o DAEE - Polder Vila Itaim.

Cardiff has 5 active community flood plans with others in the planning stage. We have produced a ‘Preparing for Emergencies – A Guide for Communities’ document which is now available to all agencies and organisations. It provides information on how to prepare, respond and recover from an incident including flooding. The document can be found via the following link; https://www.cardiff.gov.uk/ENG/Your-Council/Strategies-plans-and-policies/Emergency-Planning-and-Resilience/Emergency-Planning-and-Resilience/Pages/default.aspxWe have further developed our capability to communicate with the public with the development of the EVAC Cardiff App which is now available for both android and apple systems. Alongside the App we are developing a stand-alone website to offer further advice and information to back up the information available via the App.Parts of Cardiff now benefit from flood mitigation schemes, Rhiwbina village has a completed scheme providing flood protection to numerous properties that have been affected by flooding from Whitchurch Brook, Roath area of Cardiff around Waterloo Gardens has a scheme being built now which when complete will give flood protection to approx. 400 properties. This scheme has been developed and funded by Natural Resources Wales and Welsh Government. A coastal flood protection scheme is also being developed for future protection of the coast along Rover way.
